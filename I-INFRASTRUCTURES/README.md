# I - INFRASTRUCTURES

## Overview
The **Infrastructures** axis encompasses all ground support, airport interfaces, supply chain systems, and training facilities. This section bridges the aircraft systems with the operational environment, ensuring seamless integration between the AMPEL360 aircraft and its supporting ecosystem.

## Purpose
- Define ground support equipment (GSE) requirements and interfaces
- Establish airport and infrastructure interface standards
- Document supply chain and logistics requirements
- Specify training and simulation systems
- Enable hydrogen value chain integration
