## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document proposes an AI-driven framework for the sustainable transition of the aerospace industry, spanning:
- Conceptual design and certification
- Manufacturing and supply chains
- Operations and maintenance
- End-of-life, circularity, and recycling

AI-ASI-TP positions AI not as a side tool, but as a core decision and optimisation infrastructure for decarbonisation, resource efficiency, and circularity—under strict safety, certification, and governance constraints.

### 1.3 Early Full-Model Demonstrator – AMPEL360 Programs

To avoid a purely theoretical framework, AI-ASI-TP is anchored to one early, full-model implementation that precedes large-scale industrial deployment and full industrial Digital Twin rollout:

- This role is fulfilled by the **AMPEL360 programs**, conceived as an integrated pre-operational industrial Digital Twin of a next-generation sustainable aircraft and its supporting infrastructure.
- AMPEL360 acts as a living laboratory where AI-driven design, operations, sustainability accounting, and governance mechanisms can be developed, tested, stress-tested, and documented before they are generalized and deployed across the wider aerospace ecosystem.

**Reference statement for all stakeholders:**

> For the entire aerospace ecosystem, AI-ASI-TP is first instantiated as a single early full-model program preceding industrial operations and full-scale Digital Twin deployment: the **AMPEL360 programs**.

## 2. Executive Summary

The aerospace sector faces a dual challenge:
1. Rapid decarbonisation and sustainable transition in line with global climate targets, regulatory pressure, and ESG expectations.
2. Maintaining and improving safety, reliability, and competitiveness in one of the most complex and heavily regulated industries in the world.

The AI-Driven Aerospace Sustainable Industry Transition Proposal (AI-ASI-TP) defines a system-of-systems transition architecture that integrates:
- Sustainable propulsion and energy systems (hydrogen, hybrid-electric, SAF, advanced storage concepts).
- AI-enabled design, manufacturing, operations, and maintenance, across the entire aerospace value chain.
- Robust safety, certification, and governance frameworks, ensuring that AI is trustworthy, traceable, and acceptable to regulators and society.

As a concrete, early implementation, the AI-ASI-TP framework is instantiated in one full-model demonstrator preceding large-scale industrial operations and industrial Digital Twins: the **AMPEL360 programs**, which serve as a pre-operational sandbox for validating AI-driven sustainable aerospace transitions.

AI-ASI-TP aims to:
- Reduce lifecycle CO₂e per passenger-kilometer and per ton-kilometer.
- Improve operational efficiency, availability, and asset utilisation.
- Enable new aircraft and infrastructure concepts that are net-zero or net-negative across their lifecycle.
- Ensure a just workforce transition, upskilling personnel to work with AI and Digital Twin technologies rather than being displaced.

---

## 3. Strategic Context and Rationale

### 3.1 Sector Challenges

- **Net-zero and beyond:** Global aviation commitments to net-zero CO₂ by 2050 and rising expectations on non-CO₂ effects, noise, and local air quality.
- **Complex new architectures:** Hydrogen, fuel cells, hybrid-electric, SAF-optimised engines, open-rotor and blended-wing body (BWB) concepts increase complexity in design, operations, and certification.
- **Fragmented data & legacy tooling:** Data is scattered across OEMs, suppliers, airlines, MROs, and airports; many processes are siloed and rely on legacy, deterministic tools.
- **Trust and certification gap for AI:** AI is powerful but often treated as a "black box," incompatible with the traceability and accountability required in aviation.

### 3.2 Role of AI in a Sustainable Transition

Used responsibly, AI can:
- Accelerate early-stage design space exploration and multi-disciplinary optimisation (MDO) for cleaner aircraft and infrastructure.
- Enhance operational decision-making (trajectory optimisation, load management, hydrogen/electric energy management, predictive maintenance).
- Support virtual testing and certification, via high-fidelity digital twins and AI-assisted verification & validation.
- Orchestrate circularity and sustainable supply chains, tracking material flows, energy use, and embodied carbon across the lifecycle.

However, this must happen under:
- Strict safety and certification requirements
- Clear human authority and accountability
- Robust AI governance, traceability, and explainability

### 3.3 Why AI-Driven Transition vs. "More of the Same"

Traditional approaches are incremental and cannot fully explore:
- Very large design spaces (e.g., thousands of BWB or H₂-electric configurations).
- Multi-objective trade-offs (cost, safety, CO₂, NOₓ, noise, recyclability, manufacturability).
- Long-term lifecycle interactions, including infrastructure and end-of-life.

AI-ASI-TP therefore promotes a hybrid approach:
- Physics-informed, human-supervised AI, rather than pure black-box models.
- AI as a co-pilot for engineers, operators, and regulators.
- AI models and pipelines that are documented, auditable, and certifiable.

## 4. Vision and Objectives

### 4.1 Vision

## 10. Collaboration and Ecosystem Approach

AI-ASI-TP is inherently multi-stakeholder:

- **OEMs & Tier Suppliers:** Co-develop data models, digital twins, and AI use cases (AMPEL360 as shared demonstrator).
- **Airlines & MROs:** Provide operational data and co-design optimisation strategies and maintenance programs.
- **Airports & Energy Providers:** Co-evolve infrastructure for hydrogen, electricity, SAF, and green logistics.
- **Regulators & Standardisation Bodies:** Co-shape frameworks for safe AI integration and AI-certified workflows.
- **Academia & Research Labs:** Advance Green AI, physics-informed ML, certification methods, and lifecycle optimisation.
- **Technology Providers:** Supply AI platforms and tools emphasising traceability, explainability, and integration.

## 11. Conclusion and Call to Action

The aerospace industry is at a critical decision point. Incremental improvements alone are unlikely to achieve the climate, sustainability, and resilience goals demanded by society, regulators, and markets.

AI-ASI-TP offers a structured, certifiability-aware blueprint for:
- Harnessing AI as infrastructure, not just a gadget.
- Embedding sustainability and circularity in every lifecycle phase.
- Using **AMPEL360 programs** as the first, concrete, end-to-end early full-model demonstrator that precedes industrial-scale operations and Digital Twin roll-out.

The next step is to transform this proposal into a program of work:
- Define flagship demonstrators and work packages.
- Formalise cross-industry partnerships and governance structures.
- Align investment, research, and policy support around a single, coherent transition architecture.
