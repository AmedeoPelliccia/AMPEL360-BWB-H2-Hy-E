# P - PROGRAM

## Overview
The **Program** axis of the OPT-IN Framework covers aircraft-level configuration, geometry, ground handling, and servicing specifications. This section defines the physical characteristics and operational procedures for the AMPEL360 Blended-Wing-Body aircraft.

## Purpose
- Define aircraft dimensions, areas, and geometric specifications
- Establish ground handling procedures (lifting, shoring, towing, taxiing)
- Specify leveling and weighing requirements
- Document servicing procedures and requirements

## ATA Chapters Included

### ATA 06 - DIMENSIONS AND AREAS
Aircraft dimensions, surface areas, volumes, and geometric specifications including:
- Overall dimensions (length, width, height)
- Wing area and geometry
- Cargo compartment volumes
- Fuel tank capacities
- Reference datums and coordinate systems

### ATA 07 - LIFTING AND SHORING
Procedures and equipment for lifting and supporting the aircraft during maintenance:
- Jack points and lifting positions
- Shoring requirements and positions
- Load limits and safety factors
- Equipment specifications

### ATA 08 - LEVELING AND WEIGHING
Procedures for leveling and weighing the aircraft:
- Leveling points and procedures
- Weighing points and methods
- Center of gravity determination
- Weight and balance calculations

### ATA 09 - TOWING AND TAXIING
Ground movement procedures and equipment:
- Towing procedures and equipment
- Towing speed limits and restrictions
- Taxiing procedures
- Ground maneuvering clearances

### ATA 12 - SERVICING
Routine servicing procedures and requirements:
- Fuel servicing (including Hâ‚‚ and SAF)
- Hydraulic fluid servicing
- Oil servicing
- Potable water and waste servicing
- Compressed gas servicing
- Battery servicing

## Special Considerations for BWB Configuration
The Blended-Wing-Body configuration presents unique challenges and requirements:
- Non-traditional fuselage geometry
- Distributed propulsion integration
- Hydrogen fuel system servicing procedures
- Cryogenic system safety protocols
