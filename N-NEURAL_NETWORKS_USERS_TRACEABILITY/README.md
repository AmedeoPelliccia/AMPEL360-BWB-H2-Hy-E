# N - NEURAL NETWORKS, USERS, TRACEABILITY

## Overview
The **Neural Networks** axis represents the data lineage, traceability systems, AI/ML integration, and Digital Product Passport (DPP) infrastructure. This is the digital backbone that enables lifecycle traceability, predictive maintenance, and continuous optimization of the AMPEL360 aircraft.

## Purpose
- Establish end-to-end traceability throughout the aircraft lifecycle
- Implement Digital Product Passport (DPP) for regulatory compliance
- Enable AI/ML-driven optimization and predictive analytics
- Maintain digital thread from design through operations
- Support circular economy and sustainability goals
