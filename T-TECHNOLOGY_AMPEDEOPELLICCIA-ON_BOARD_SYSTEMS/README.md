# T - TECHNOLOGY (Amedeo Pelliccia - On Board Systems)

## Overview
The **Technology** axis represents all on-board aircraft systems, organized using the **A-M-E-D-E-O-P-E-L-I-C-C-I-A₂** taxonomy. This innovative classification system groups systems by functional domain while maintaining full ATA chapter compatibility for regulatory compliance.

## Purpose
To provide a comprehensive, modular structure for all aircraft on-board systems that:
- Enables concurrent engineering across multiple disciplines
- Maintains traceability to ATA standards
- Facilitates system integration and interface management
- Supports digital twin and AI-driven optimization

## Integration Philosophy
The AMPEDEOPELLICCIA taxonomy enables:
1. **Functional Grouping**: Systems grouped by primary function
2. **Cross-Domain Traceability**: Explicit links between logical, physical, thermal, and energy domains
3. **Modular Development**: Independent development with clear interfaces
4. **Digital Thread**: Seamless integration with digital twin and DPP
5. **AI Readiness**: Structure supports machine learning and autonomous optimization
