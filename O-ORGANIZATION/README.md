# O - ORGANIZATION

## Overview
The **Organization** axis of the OPT-IN Framework encompasses governance, certification, airworthiness, and maintenance policy information. This section defines the high-level rules, regulations, and organizational standards that govern the entire AMPEL360 program.

## Purpose
- Establish maintenance policies and procedures
- Define airworthiness limitations and compliance requirements
- Set time limits and maintenance check intervals
- Provide general organizational information and standards

## ATA Chapters Included

### ATA 00 - GENERAL
General information, aircraft systems overview, and general specifications.

### ATA 01 - MAINTENANCE POLICY INFORMATION
Maintenance program policies, scheduled maintenance requirements, and operational policies.

### ATA 04 - AIRWORTHINESS LIMITATIONS
Critical limitations that must be observed to maintain airworthiness certification, including structural life limits, system operational restrictions, and mandatory inspections.

### ATA 05 - TIME LIMITS / MAINTENANCE CHECKS
Scheduled maintenance check intervals, time-based component replacement requirements, and periodic inspection schedules.
