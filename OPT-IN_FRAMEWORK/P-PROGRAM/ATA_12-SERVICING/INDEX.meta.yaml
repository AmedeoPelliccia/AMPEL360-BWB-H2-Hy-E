notes: |
  This chapter is critical for safe ground operations of the AMPEL360 aircraft,
  particularly given the revolutionary cryogenic hydrogen fuel system. All 
  servicing procedures must be performed by qualified and certified personnel 
  following strict safety protocols. The hydrogen fueling procedures represent 
  a paradigm shift in commercial aviation ground operations and require 
  specialized infrastructure and training.
