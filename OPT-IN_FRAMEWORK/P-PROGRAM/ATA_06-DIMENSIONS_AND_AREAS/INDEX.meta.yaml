  ATA Chapter 06 establishes the official dimensional data for the AMPEL360 
  Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft. This chapter provides comprehensive 
  documentation of all physical dimensions, surface areas, volumes, and 
  geometric characteristics required for ground handling, hangar planning, 
  maintenance access, regulatory compliance, and operational procedures.

scope:
  - Principal dimensions (length, wingspan, height)
  - Surface areas (wing, control surfaces, wetted area)
  - Internal volumes (fuel, cargo, equipment bays)
  - Cabin dimensions and configurations
  - Cargo compartment dimensions
  - Access dimensions (doors, hatches, panels)
  - Zonal definitions for maintenance
  - Ground handling envelopes
  - Airport compatibility data

notes: |
  This chapter is foundational to the entire P-PROGRAM axis and provides 
  critical data for multiple downstream systems and documentation. All 
  dimensional data must be verified through formal measurement procedures 
  and maintained under strict configuration control. Changes to dimensional 
  data may require regulatory notification and operator service bulletins.
