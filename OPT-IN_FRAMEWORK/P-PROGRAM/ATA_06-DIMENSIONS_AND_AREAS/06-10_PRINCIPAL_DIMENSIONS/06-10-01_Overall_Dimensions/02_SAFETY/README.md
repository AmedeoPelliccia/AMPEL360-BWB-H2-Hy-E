# Safety Documentation: 06-10-01 - Overall Dimensions

## Purpose
This folder contains safety-related documentation for the overall dimensions of the AMPEL360 aircraft, including hazard analysis, safety zones, and risk mitigation strategies related to dimensional characteristics.

## Key Safety Considerations

### 1. Ground Handling Safety
- Propulsor safety zones (engine running envelope)
- Wingtip clearance requirements
- Tail stand requirements (tipback prevention)
- Hydrogen fueling safety zones

### 2. Emergency Egress
- Emergency exit spacing verification ([CS-25.803](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27))
- Evacuation path analysis (90-second requirement)
- Door clearance verification

### 3. Hydrogen System Safety
- LH₂ tank clearance envelopes
- Hot work exclusion zones (10m radius)
- Personnel access restrictions during fueling
- Safety zone marking requirements

## Safety Analysis Reports
- Dimensional Hazard Analysis (DHA)
- Ground Operations Safety Assessment (GOSA)
