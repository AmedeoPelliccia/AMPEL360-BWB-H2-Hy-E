# Operations and Maintenance: 06-10-01 - Overall Dimensions

## Purpose
This folder contains operational procedures and maintenance instructions related to the overall dimensions of the AMPEL360 aircraft.

## Operational Procedures

### 1. Ground Handling Procedures
- **Airport Parking Procedures:** Gate approach and parking procedures for BWB configuration
- **Towing Procedures:** Special considerations for 65m wingspan and 22.5m width
- **Hangar Entry Procedures:** Diagonal entry procedures for narrow hangars
- **Safety Zone Management:** Propulsor safety zones, hydrogen fueling zones

### 2. Pre-Flight Inspection
- **Walk-Around Inspection:** Visual inspection of overall aircraft condition
- **Dimensional Damage Assessment:** Procedures for detecting dimensional changes (post-hard landing)
- **Propulsor Clearance Check:** Visual verification of 3.8m ground clearance
- **Wing Tip Inspection:** Verify no contact damage during ground operations

### 3. Ground Service Procedures
- **Fueling Procedures:** LH₂ fueling safety zones and clearances
- **Cargo Loading:** Container positioning and clearance verification
- **Passenger Boarding:** Jetway positioning and door alignment
- **Ground Power Connection:** GPU clearance from propulsor safety zones

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Periodic Dimensional Checks
- **A-Check (500 FH):** Visual inspection for dimensional damage
- **C-Check (9,000 FH):** Wingspan measurement (detect permanent deformation)
  - Procedure: Laser distance measurement from centerline to wingtips
  - Acceptance: ±100mm from nominal (65,000 mm)
  
- **D-Check (36,000 FH):** Full aircraft laser scan
  - Procedure: Position aircraft on level jig, laser tracker measurement
  - Acceptance: Compare to original as-built dimensions

### 2. Damage Assessment Procedures
- **Post-Hard Landing Inspection:**
  - Measure fuselage length (detect buckle): ±50mm acceptance
  - Measure wing dihedral (detect permanent set): ±2° acceptance
  - Measure propulsor clearance: ≥3.5m minimum

- **Post-Lightning Strike Inspection:**
  - Local dimensional measurement around strike zone
  - Detect composite delamination bulge: ±5mm acceptance

- **Post-Ground Collision:**
  - Wingtip or tail damage assessment
  - Dimensional survey to determine repair scope

### 3. Dimensional Restoration Procedures
- **Wing Rigging:** Adjust wing alignment if dihedral/incidence out of tolerance
- **Landing Gear Adjustment:** Adjust gear strut lengths to maintain propulsor clearance
- **Panel Alignment:** Adjust door/panel fit if dimensional changes detected

## Maintenance Tools and Equipment

### Dimensional Measurement Equipment
- **Laser Distance Meter:** Wingspan, length, height measurement (±5mm accuracy)
- **Laser Tracker:** Full aircraft 3D measurement (±2mm accuracy)
- **Water Level:** Aircraft leveling for dimensional measurement
- **Plumb Bobs:** Vertical alignment verification

### Special Tools
- **Wing Jacks:** Lift aircraft for landing gear dimensional inspection
- **Tail Stand:** Support aft fuselage during CG management
- **Tow Bar (Custom):** Low-profile design for BWB nose gear

## Operational Limitations

### Dimensional Constraints
- **Maximum Crosswind (Taxi):** 35 knots (wingspan consideration)
- **Minimum Taxiway Width:** 25m (22.5m BWB width + margins)
- **Minimum Gate Size:** 75m × 80m parking stand
- **Hangar Door Clearance:** 70m width × 13m height minimum

### Weight and Balance Constraints
- **Tail Stand Required:** If CG >62% MAC during loading/unloading
- **Ballast Required:** If CG <45% MAC (ferry flight configuration)
- **Maximum Ramp Weight:** 87,000 kg (affects gear stance dimensions)

## Training Requirements

### Ground Crew Training
- **BWB Familiarization:** Unique dimensional characteristics vs. conventional aircraft
- **Safety Zone Awareness:** Propulsor and hydrogen safety zones
- **Towing Procedures:** Special considerations for BWB configuration
- **Emergency Egress:** Multiple exit locations due to BWB width

### Maintenance Personnel Training
- **Dimensional Measurement:** Laser tracker operation and interpretation
- **Damage Assessment:** Dimensional damage detection procedures
- **Rigging Procedures:** Wing and control surface alignment
