  ATA Chapter 09 establishes the procedures, equipment specifications, and 
  safety requirements for towing the AMPEL360 Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft 
  and defines taxiing capabilities and limitations. This chapter is essential 
  for safe ground operations, airport compatibility, and operational efficiency, 
  with special considerations for hydrogen safety and electric taxi systems.

scope:
  - Towing procedures (powerback, long-distance, emergency)
  - Tow bar specifications and tow fitting design
  - Taxiing procedures (normal, electric, one-engine, emergency)
  - Turning radius data and maneuvering envelope
  - Ground clearances (propulsor, wingtip, tail)
  - CG limitations for towing
  - Hydrogen system safety during ground operations
  - Electric taxi system capability
  - Ground equipment requirements
  - Special procedures (contaminated surfaces, hangar operations)

notes: |
  This chapter is critical for safe ground operations and must be coordinated 
  with airport authorities, ground handling service providers, and maintenance 
  organizations. Special attention must be paid to hydrogen safety protocols 
  and BWB-specific ground handling requirements. Changes to towing procedures 
  or equipment specifications may require regulatory notification and operator 
  service bulletins.
