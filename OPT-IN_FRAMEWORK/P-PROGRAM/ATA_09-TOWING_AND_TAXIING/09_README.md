## AMPEL360 Unique Characteristics

### 1. **Blended Wing Body (BWB) Ground Handling**
The AMPEL360's BWB configuration creates unique ground handling challenges:

**Geometric Characteristics:**
- **Wingspan:** 65.0m (wide lateral envelope)
- **Overall Length:** 52.5m (no tail cone overhand)
- **Wheelbase:** 23.8m (nose to main gear)
- **Main Gear Track:** 15.6m (wide lateral stance)
- **Ground Contact:** Triangular footprint (stable but different from conventional)

**Advantages:**
- Wide main gear track provides excellent lateral stability
- Low center of gravity (4.5m vs. 6-8m conventional) reduces tipback risk
- No tail overhand simplifies parking/maneuvering

**Challenges:**
- Wide wingspan requires increased taxiway/apron clearances
- Propulsor ground clearance (3.8m) limits operations on uneven surfaces
- No conventional vertical stabilizer for visual reference during towing
- Wide center body creates unique visibility challenges for tug operators

### 2. **Upper-Surface Propulsor Ground Clearance**
Twin propulsors mounted above BWB center body affect ground operations:

**Propulsor Dimensions:**
- **Diameter:** 5.2m (blade tip to tip)
- **Ground Clearance:** 3.8m (minimum, static condition)
- **Dynamic Clearance:** 3.6m (compressed struts during taxi)
- **Overhead Clearance Required:** 12m minimum (for jetways, hangar doors)

**Ground Operation Restrictions:**
- **Maximum Pavement Slope:** ±3° (beyond this, propulsor strike risk)
- **Taxiway Crown:** Maximum 2% cross-slope
- **Speed Bumps:** Prohibited in aircraft movement areas
- **Ground Equipment:** Maximum height 3.5m when operating near aircraft

**Propulsor Protection:**
- Blade rotation locks must be installed during towing (prevent windmilling)
- Intake/exhaust covers installed for extended parking
- Ground crew trained to maintain minimum 5m clearance from propulsors

### 3. **Hydrogen System Safety During Ground Operations**
Cryogenic LH₂ fuel system presents unique hazards during towing/taxiing:

**Ground Operations Safety Protocol:**

**Before Towing:**
1. **LH₂ Tank Status Check:** Verify tank pressure <3.5 bar (normal operating)
2. **Leak Detection:** Walk-around inspection with portable H₂ detector
3. **Vent System Check:** Ensure pressure relief system operational
4. **Hot Work Clearance:** No hot work within 15m of aircraft during towing
5. **Fire Equipment:** CO₂/dry chemical extinguisher on tug (minimum 20 kg capacity)

**During Taxiing:**
- Continuous H₂ monitoring via aircraft health monitoring system
- Automatic warnings if H₂ detected in compartments (>10 ppm)
- Emergency shutdown procedure if leak detected (ATA 28 reference)

**Safety Zones:**
- **No Smoking Zone:** 25m radius from aircraft at all times
- **Hot Work Prohibited:** 15m radius (welding, grinding, open flame)
- **Vehicle Restrictions:** Only H₂-rated ground equipment within 10m during fueling

**Boil-Off Management:**
- Normal boil-off: 4.8 kg/hour vented safely to atmosphere
- Vent stack directs H₂ upward (dispersion >10m above ground)
- Ground crew must not walk through vent plume

### 4. **Composite Structure Protection**
Carbon fiber composite airframe requires careful ground handling:

**Surface Protection:**
- **Tow Bar Attach Point:** Metal fitting bonded into composite structure
- **Jack Pad Protection:** Rubber protectors prevent metal-on-composite contact
- **FOD Prevention:** Strict FOD control (dropped tools can cause composite damage)
- **Chemical Protection:** Avoid hydraulic fluid/fuel spills on composite (delamination risk)

**Ground Handling Precautions:**
- Tow bar must not contact composite surfaces during attachment/removal
- Ground crew trained to identify composite damage (dents, delamination)
- Post-tow inspection for accidental damage (visual check + tap test)

### 5. **Wide Center Body Taxi Visibility**
BWB center body width (22.5m) affects pilot visibility during taxiing:

**Visibility Challenges:**
- Wingtips not visible from cockpit (too far lateral - 32.5m from centerline)
- No vertical stabilizer for aft reference
- Wide cabin creates blind spots in lateral vision

**Solutions:**
- **Wing Walkers:** Required for tight maneuvering in congested ramps
- **Taxi Cameras:** External cameras on wingtips + aft (ATA 31 integration)
- **Ground Crew Communication:** Standard marshalling signals + radio
- **Taxiway Centerline Guidance:** Pilot follows centerline markings (HUD guidance)

**Taxi Camera System:**
- 4× cameras (left wingtip, right wingtip, nose, tail)
- Real-time display on cockpit multifunction displays (MFD)
- Fish-eye lens provides 180° field of view
- Infrared capability for night/low visibility operations

### 6. **Electric Propulsor Taxi Capability**
AMPEL360 can taxi using electric propulsors (electric taxi system):

**Electric Taxi Mode:**
- Propulsors powered by fuel cells (no turbine combustion)
- Quiet operation (noise <70 dBA at 25m)
- Zero emissions during taxi (no CO₂, no NOₓ)
- Reduces fuel consumption (no turbine idle burn)

**Limitations:**
- Maximum taxi speed: 15 knots (27 km/h) in electric mode
- Maximum taxi distance: 5 km (fuel cell thermal management limit)
- Not available if fuel cell system inoperative
- Requires battery state of charge >30%

**Benefits:**
- Reduced noise in airport vicinity
- Lower operating costs (electric taxi ~$50/flight vs. $200 turbine taxi)
- Meets future airport green taxi requirements

## Towing Procedures

### 1. **Power-Back Towing**
**Definition:** Aircraft pushed backwards from gate using tug

## Taxiing Procedures

### 1. **Normal Taxiing**
**Propulsor Power Taxiing:**

**Before Taxi:**
- Obtain taxi clearance from ATC
- Verify brakes operational (accumulator pressure >3,000 psi)
- Check nosewheel steering operational (±70° steering range)
- Verify fuel cell system operational (if electric taxi planned)

**During Taxi:**

- **Congested Areas:** 5 knots (9 km/h) maximum
- **Centerline Guidance:** Maintain aircraft centerline on taxiway centerline
- **Visual Clearance:** Verify wingtip/propulsor clearances using taxi cameras

**Taxiing Technique:**
- **Thrust Management:** Use minimum thrust necessary (idle power sufficient for level taxi)
- **Brake Usage:** Anticipate stops (avoid heavy braking)
- **Steering:** Smooth inputs (avoid jerky steering - passenger comfort)
- **Contaminated Surfaces:** Reduce speed 50% on wet/icy taxiways

### 2. **Electric Taxi Mode**
**Using Fuel Cell Propulsor Power Only:**

**Activation:**
- Fuel cell system operational (400 kW available power)
- Battery state of charge >30%
- Select "E-TAXI" mode on propulsor control panel
- Propulsors powered by fuel cell (no turbine start)

**Operating Envelope:**
- **Thrust Available:** 20 kN per propulsor (total 40 kN)
- **Maximum Speed:** 15 knots (27 km/h)
- **Maximum Distance:** 5 km (thermal management limit)
- **Slope Limit:** ±2% grade

**Benefits:**
- Quiet operation (<70 dBA at 25m)
- Zero emissions during taxi
- Fuel savings: ~30 kg H₂ saved per taxi vs. turbine idle

**Limitations:**
- Not available above 2,000m elevation (reduced air density)
- Not available in icing conditions (propulsor anti-ice requires turbine)
- Requires fuel cell system operational

### 3. **One-Engine Taxi**
**Definition:** Taxiing with one propulsor operating (fuel savings)

**Procedure:**
- Start only left propulsor (standard procedure)
- Right propulsor windmilling (blades free to rotate)
- **Thrust Available:** 50% (one propulsor only)
- **Maximum Weight:** 100,000 kg (reduced from MTOW 120,000 kg)
- **Slope Limit:** ±1% grade

**Restrictions:**
- Not approved for icy/slippery surfaces (asymmetric thrust control difficult)
- Maximum taxi speed: 20 knots
- Must start second propulsor if thrust insufficient

### 4. **Emergency/Abnormal Taxiing**

**Nosewheel Steering Failure:**
- Use differential braking for directional control
- Maximum taxi speed: 5 knots
- Requires wing walkers for all turns
- Request tug assistance if unable to control direction

**Brake Failure (Single System):**
- Hydraulic A or B system failure → other system available
- Normal taxi speed acceptable
- Anticipate longer stopping distances
- Notify maintenance upon arrival at gate

**Propulsor Failure (Both):**
- Request tug for towing to gate
- Not approved to taxi using only nose gear towing
- Aircraft must be towed (cannot self-taxi)

## Turning Radius Data

### Nosewheel Steering Limits
**Steering Range:** ±70° (±1.22 radians)

**Minimum Turning Radius:**
| Configuration | Outside Wingtip Radius | Inside Wingtip Radius | Propulsor Clearance |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **70° Steering** | 42.5m | 10.2m | 3.8m (adequate) |
| **45° Steering** | 58.3m | 25.9m | 3.8m (adequate) |
| **30° Steering** | 83.7m | 51.3m | 3.8m (adequate) |

**Practical Minimum Turn Radius:** 45m (outside wingtip) at 70° steering

**Turn Radius Calculation:**
```
R_outside = √[(L² + (T/2)²] + W/2

Where:
L = Wheelbase = 23.8m
T = Main gear track = 15.6m
W = Wingspan = 65.0m
θ = Steering angle = 70°

R_inside = R_outside - W
R_inside = 42.5 - 65.0 = -22.5m (geometric center of turn)
```

**Interpretation:**
- AMPEL360 can execute 180° turn in 85m width (2× R_outside)
- Tighter turns than Boeing 787-9 (requires 92m width)
- BWB wide stance provides excellent turn performance

### Taxiway Compatibility
**ICAO Taxiway Width Requirements (Code E Aircraft):**
- **Taxiway Width:** 23m minimum (typical: 25m for Code E)
- **Taxiway Edge Safety Margin:** 4.5m each side
- **Total Required Width:** 32m (23m + 2×4.5m)

**AMPEL360 Clearances:**
- Half-wingspan: 32.5m
- **Required Taxiway Width:** 32.5m + 2×4.5m = 41.5m
- Standard Code E taxiway (44m) provides adequate clearance ✓

**Turn Fillets:**
- 90° taxiway turn requires 30m radius fillet (outside edge)
- AMPEL360 outside wingtip radius: 42.5m
- **Fillet Adequacy:** Adequate if aircraft reduces speed to <5 knots during turn

## CG Limitations for Towing

### Towing CG Envelope
**Approved CG Range:** 25% MAC to 45% MAC

**Rationale:**
- **Forward Limit (25% MAC):** Prevents excessive nose-down attitude during towing (tail strike risk)
- **Aft Limit (45% MAC):** Prevents tipback during towing (nose gear unloading)

**CG Calculation:**
```
CG % MAC = [(CG_station - LEMAC) / MAC] × 100
LEMAC = FS 18,000
MAC = 17,000mm

Forward Limit: CG_station = 18,000 + (0.25 × 17,000) = FS 22,250
Aft Limit: CG_station = 18,000 + (0.45 × 17,000) = FS 25,650
```

**Pre-Tow CG Verification:**
- Check current weight and CG from load sheet
- If outside towing limits, reposition cargo/ballast
- Document CG verification in towing log

### Tipback Risk Analysis
**Tipback Condition:** Nose gear lifts off ground during towing (CG too far aft)

**Critical CG Position (Tipback Threshold):**
```
CG_critical = X_main_gear = FS 23,800 (main gear position)
CG_critical % MAC = [(23,800 - 18,000) / 17,000] × 100 = 34.1% MAC
```

**Safety Margin:**
- Towing aft limit: 45% MAC
- Tipback threshold: 34.1% MAC
- **Margin:** 10.9% MAC (adequate safety buffer)

**Note:** 45% MAC limit is more restrictive than tipback threshold (provides safety margin)

**Tail Stand Requirement:**
- Tail stand mandatory if CG >42% MAC during loading/unloading
- Not required during towing (45% MAC limit prevents tipback)

## Ground Clearances

### Propulsor Ground Clearance
**Static Clearance:** 3.8m (blade tip to ground, gear at normal extension)

**Dynamic Clearances:**
| Condition | Clearance | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Static (empty) | 3.9m | Struts fully extended |
| Static (MTOW) | 3.7m | Struts compressed |
| Taxi (MTOW) | 3.6m | Dynamic strut compression |
| Maximum pitch-up (15°) | 3.0m | Aft propulsor (critical) |
| Maximum pitch-down (-5°) | 3.4m | Forward propulsor (less critical) |

**Pavement Slope Limits:**
- **Level Pavement:** No restriction
- **±1° Slope:** Adequate clearance (3.6m minimum)
- **±2° Slope:** Adequate clearance (3.4m minimum)
- **±3° Slope:** Minimum clearance (3.1m) - approach with caution
- **>3° Slope:** Propulsor strike risk - NOT APPROVED

**Ground Equipment Height Restriction:**
- Maximum height: 3.5m when operating within 10m of aircraft
- Examples: Catering trucks (3.2m), cargo loaders (3.0m), fuel trucks (2.8m)

### Wingtip Clearance

**Clearance Envelope:**
- Wingtips well clear of ground equipment (no strike risk)
- Jetway height: Typically 4.0-6.5m (adequate clearance)
- Hangar door height: Minimum 13m required (11.2m aircraft height + margin)

### Tail Clearance
**Tail Cone Ground Clearance:** 3.8m (aft-most point to ground)

**Tail Strike Limits:**
- **Pitch-Up Limit:** 11.5° (tail strikes ground beyond this angle)
- **Towing Safety:** Aircraft maintained level during towing (no tail strike risk)
- **Rotation:** 8.5° takeoff rotation (adequate clearance, 3° margin)
