## Overview

This diagram visualizes the seven-layer traceability framework showing data flows and information linkages:

**Layer 1: Data Provenance**
- Source systems
- Data collection points
- Quality metrics
- Custody chain

**Layer 2: Training Traceability**
- Dataset versions
- Model architectures
- Hyperparameters
- Training logs

**Layer 3: Validation Evidence**
- Test cases
- Test results
- Corner cases
- Certification evidence

**Layer 4: Deployment Configuration**
- Aircraft installations
- Hardware platforms
- Software environments
- Safety monitors

**Layer 5: Runtime Monitoring**
- Operational predictions
- Performance metrics
- OOD detections
- Anomalies

**Layer 6: User Interactions**
- Crew decisions
- Overrides
- Feedback
- Training records

**Layer 7: Outcome Analysis**
- Performance analysis
- Incident investigations
- Lessons learned
- Model improvements

## Data Connections

The diagram shows:
- Forward traceability (requirements → implementation → operation)
- Backward traceability (incident → root cause → requirements)
- Lateral traceability (related artifacts at same layer)
- Temporal traceability (version history and changes)
