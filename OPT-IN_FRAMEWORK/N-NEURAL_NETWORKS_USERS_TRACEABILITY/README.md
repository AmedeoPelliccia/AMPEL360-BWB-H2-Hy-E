# N - Neural Networks, Users, Traceability

This axis of the OPT-IN Framework encompasses artificial intelligence, machine learning, data lineage, user interactions, and the comprehensive traceability systems that enable **CAOS (Computer Aided Operations and Services)** — the fourth pillar of digital engineering.

---

## Overview

The N-axis bridges the gap between traditional Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and modern Service Lifecycle Management (SLM), enabling:

- **Digital Product Passports (DPP)** for complete lifecycle traceability
- **AI/ML model development and deployment** for autonomous operations
- **Service Twins** that extend Digital Twins with operational intelligence
- **Product-as-Intelligent-Service (PaaSI)** business models
- **Continuous learning and optimization** throughout the operational lifecycle

## Strategic Role in AMPEL360

For the AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E hybrid hydrogen aircraft:

1. **Operational Intelligence:** Real-time fleet health management and predictive maintenance
2. **Energy Optimization:** AI-driven fuel cell and battery management for hybrid propulsion
3. **Sustainability Tracking:** Continuous measurement and optimization of carbon footprint
4. **Circular Economy Enablement:** Data-driven end-of-life decisions for remanufacture and recycling
5. **Autonomous Operations:** Self-optimizing systems that learn and adapt in service
