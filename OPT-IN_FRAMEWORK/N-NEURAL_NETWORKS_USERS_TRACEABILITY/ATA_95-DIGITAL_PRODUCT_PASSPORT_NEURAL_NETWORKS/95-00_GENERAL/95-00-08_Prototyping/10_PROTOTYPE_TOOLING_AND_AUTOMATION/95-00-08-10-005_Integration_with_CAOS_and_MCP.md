## 1. Purpose

Integration with CAOS system and Model Context Protocol

## 2. Scope

This document covers integration with caos and mcp within the prototyping framework of ATA Chapter 95 Digital Product Passport Neural Networks.

## 3. Integration with CAOS and MCP Overview

This document defines tools and automation infrastructure supporting the prototyping process, from notebooks to CI/CD pipelines.

### 3.1 Tooling Categories
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter notebooks, IDEs, debuggers
- **Automation Tools**: CI/CD pipelines, auto-documentation
- **Collaboration Tools**: Version control, code review
- **Integration Tools**: CAOS hooks, MCP interfaces

### 3.2 Best Practices
- Standardized notebook templates
- Automated testing in CI/CD
- Auto-generated documentation from code
- Seamless integration with CAOS lifecycle management

Refer to ASSETS folder for tooling flow diagrams, templates, and configuration samples.

## 4. Relationship to Lifecycle Stages

### 4.1 Connection to Engineering (95-00-06)

Integration with CAOS and MCP prototypes provide validated concepts and implementations that feed into production engineering models.

**Inputs from Engineering**:
- Design specifications
- Technical constraints
- Performance targets

**Outputs to Engineering**:
- Validated prototypes
- Performance metrics
- Implementation recommendations

### 4.2 Connection to V&V (95-00-07)

Integration with CAOS and MCP prototypes undergo validation that prepares them for formal V&V processes.

**Inputs from V&V**:
- Test scenarios
- Acceptance criteria
- Quality standards

**Outputs to V&V**:
- Prototype test results
- Failure mode analysis
- Validation evidence

### 4.3 Connection to Certification (95-00-10)

Integration with CAOS and MCP prototypes provide early evidence for certification planning.

**Certification Relevance**:
- Regulatory requirement validation
- Safety analysis inputs
- Compliance demonstration

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Getting Started

1. Review strategy document
2. Identify prototype requirements
3. Allocate resources
4. Execute prototype development
5. Document results

### 5.2 Best Practices

- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Engage stakeholders early
- Plan for transition to production

## 6. Success Criteria

Prototypes in this category are successful when they:
- Meet defined objectives
- Provide actionable insights
- Pass maturity gate reviews
- Enable decision-making
