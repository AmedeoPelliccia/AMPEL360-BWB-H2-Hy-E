## 1. Purpose

Internal stakeholder demonstration protocols

## 2. Scope

This document covers internal demos definition within the prototyping framework of ATA Chapter 95 Digital Product Passport Neural Networks.

## 3. Internal Demos Definition Overview

This document defines demonstration protocols for showcasing NN capabilities to internal stakeholders, customers, and regulatory authorities.

### 3.1 Demo Objectives
- Build confidence in NN technology
- Demonstrate compliance with requirements
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Support business development

### 3.2 Demo Types
- **Internal Demos**: Technical deep-dives for engineering teams
- **Customer Demos**: Business value and capabilities
- **Regulatory Demos**: Compliance and safety focus
- **Public Demos**: Technology showcase events

Refer to ASSETS folder for demo scenarios, scripts, and feedback forms.

## 4. Relationship to Lifecycle Stages

### 4.1 Connection to Engineering (95-00-06)

Internal Demos Definition prototypes provide validated concepts and implementations that feed into production engineering models.

**Inputs from Engineering**:
- Design specifications
- Technical constraints
- Performance targets

**Outputs to Engineering**:
- Validated prototypes
- Performance metrics
- Implementation recommendations

### 4.2 Connection to V&V (95-00-07)

Internal Demos Definition prototypes undergo validation that prepares them for formal V&V processes.

**Inputs from V&V**:
- Test scenarios
- Acceptance criteria
- Quality standards

**Outputs to V&V**:
- Prototype test results
- Failure mode analysis
- Validation evidence

### 4.3 Connection to Certification (95-00-10)

Internal Demos Definition prototypes provide early evidence for certification planning.

**Certification Relevance**:
- Regulatory requirement validation
- Safety analysis inputs
- Compliance demonstration

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Getting Started

1. Review strategy document
2. Identify prototype requirements
3. Allocate resources
4. Execute prototype development
5. Document results

### 5.2 Best Practices

- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Engage stakeholders early
- Plan for transition to production

## 6. Success Criteria

Prototypes in this category are successful when they:
- Meet defined objectives
- Provide actionable insights
- Pass maturity gate reviews
- Enable decision-making
