## 1. Purpose

HIL simulation and testing configurations

## 2. Scope

This document covers hardware-in-the-loop prototype setups within the prototyping framework of ATA Chapter 95 Digital Product Passport Neural Networks.

## 3. Hardware-in-the-Loop Prototype Setups Overview

This document defines hardware test rigs and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setups for validating NN prototypes with real sensors and avionics hardware.

### 3.1 Test Rig Purpose
- Validate NN models with actual sensor data
- Test real-time performance on target hardware
- Identify hardware-specific issues early
- Support certification testing requirements

### 3.2 HIL Configuration
- Sensor simulators for controlled testing
- Real sensors for validation
- Target compute platforms (embedded systems)
- Data acquisition and logging systems

Refer to ASSETS folder for rig layouts, IO mappings, and test procedures.

## 4. Relationship to Lifecycle Stages

Hardware-in-the-Loop Prototype Setups prototypes provide validated concepts and implementations that feed into production engineering models.

**Inputs from Engineering**:
- Design specifications
- Technical constraints
- Performance targets

**Outputs to Engineering**:
- Validated prototypes
- Performance metrics
- Implementation recommendations

### 4.2 Connection to V&V (95-00-07)

Hardware-in-the-Loop Prototype Setups prototypes undergo validation that prepares them for formal V&V processes.

**Inputs from V&V**:
- Test scenarios
- Acceptance criteria
- Quality standards

**Outputs to V&V**:
- Prototype test results
- Failure mode analysis
- Validation evidence

### 4.3 Connection to Certification (95-00-10)

Hardware-in-the-Loop Prototype Setups prototypes provide early evidence for certification planning.

**Certification Relevance**:
- Regulatory requirement validation
- Safety analysis inputs
- Compliance demonstration

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Getting Started

1. Review strategy document
2. Identify prototype requirements
3. Allocate resources
4. Execute prototype development
5. Document results

### 5.2 Best Practices

- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Engage stakeholders early
- Plan for transition to production

## 6. Success Criteria

Prototypes in this category are successful when they:
- Meet defined objectives
- Provide actionable insights
- Pass maturity gate reviews
- Enable decision-making
