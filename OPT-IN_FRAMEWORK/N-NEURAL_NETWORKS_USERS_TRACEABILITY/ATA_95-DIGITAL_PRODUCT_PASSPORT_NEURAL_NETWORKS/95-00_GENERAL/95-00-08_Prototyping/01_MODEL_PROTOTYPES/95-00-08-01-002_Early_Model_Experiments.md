## 1. Purpose

Documents early-stage model experiments and proof-of-concept work.

## 2. Experiment Workflow

### 2.1 Hypothesis Definition

- Define clear hypothesis to test
- Identify success criteria
- Estimate resource requirements

### 2.2 Experiment Execution

- Train model on synthetic/sample data
- Measure baseline performance
- Document results and insights

### 2.3 Result Analysis

- Compare against baseline
- Identify failure modes
- Decide on next steps (continue, pivot, terminate)

## 3. Experiment Catalog

All experiments are logged in `ASSETS/95-00-08-01-A-001_Model_Prototype_Catalog.csv`

## 4. Best Practices

- Keep experiments small and focused
- Use version control for experiment code
- Document negative results (what didn't work)
- Share insights across teams
