# 95-00-10-00-001 Certification Strategy

## Document Information
- **Document ID**: 95-00-10-00-001
- **Title**: Certification Strategy
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Active
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-17

## Purpose

This document defines the overarching certification strategy for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft, specifically addressing the unique challenges posed by:
- Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration
- Hydrogen fuel cell propulsion system
- Neural network-based AI systems (CAOS)
- Digital Product Passport (DPP) integration
- Carbon-negative operational framework

## Scope

This certification strategy covers:
- Regulatory framework identification and alignment
- Certification basis establishment
- Compliance roadmap and milestones
- AI/ML-specific certification approaches
- Safety case development for neural networks
- Authority engagement and submission planning

## Regulatory Context

### Primary Certification Authorities
- **EASA** (European Union Aviation Safety Agency)
- **FAA** (Federal Aviation Administration)

### Key Regulatory Frameworks
- CS-25 (EASA) / FAR Part 25 (FAA) - Large Aeroplanes
- [EASA AI Roadmap 2.0](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/light/topics/artificial-intelligence-roadmap)
- [FAA AI Assurance Framework](https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/)
- [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) compliance considerations
- [DO-178C](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials) (Software), [DO-254](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials) (Hardware), [DO-326A](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials) (Airworthiness Security)

## Certification Approach

### 1. Phased Certification Strategy
The certification will follow a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Type Design Approval**
- BWB airframe certification
- Hydrogen propulsion system certification
- Conventional avionics and systems

**Phase 2: AI System Supplemental Type Certification**
- CAOS neural network functions
- Predictive maintenance AI
- Optimization algorithms

**Phase 3: DPP and Continuous Certification**
- Digital twin integration
- Blockchain-based traceability
- In-service monitoring framework

### 2. Special Conditions and Novel Approaches
Given the novel design elements:
- BWB configuration requires special conditions (no direct precedent in CS-25/Part 25)
- Hydrogen systems require special conditions (adaptation from TSO standards)
- Neural networks require novel certification methods (EASA AI Roadmap, FAA AI AF)

### 3. Methods of Compliance (MOC)
Defined approaches for demonstrating compliance:
- Analysis (structural, performance, safety)
- Testing (ground, flight, environmental)
- Simulation (validated digital twins)
- Inspection and verification
- Similarity to existing certified designs (where applicable)

## Key Challenges

### 1. BWB Configuration
- Limited precedent in commercial aviation
- Novel structural load paths
- Emergency egress considerations
- Center of gravity management

### 2. Hydrogen Propulsion
- Novel fuel system architecture
- Cryogenic storage and handling
- Safety systems and containment
- Ground infrastructure interface

### 3. AI/Neural Networks
- Non-deterministic behavior
- Training data validation
- Model versioning and updates
- Explainability and transparency
- Runtime monitoring

### 4. Digital Product Passport
- Regulatory acceptance of blockchain evidence
- Data integrity and immutability
- Privacy and confidentiality
- Long-term data retention

## Safety Case Philosophy

The certification strategy adopts a goal-based safety case approach:
- Top-level safety goals derived from regulatory requirements
- Hierarchical argument structure (GSN notation)
- Evidence traceability from requirements to verification
- Explicit treatment of assumptions and context
- Continuous assurance for AI systems

## Authority Engagement Plan

### Pre-Application Phase
- Concept familiarization meetings with EASA/FAA
- Position papers on novel technologies
- Joint workshops on BWB, H₂, and AI certification

### Application Phase
- Formal certification basis submission
- Issue papers for special conditions
- Regular technical meetings (monthly)

### Compliance Phase
- Compliance demonstration plans
- Witness testing coordination
- Finding resolution and CAPA tracking

### Post-Certification Phase
- Continuing airworthiness management
- In-service monitoring feedback loop
- Change control and configuration management

## Integration with Other Lifecycle Stages

This certification strategy is tightly integrated with:
- **95-00-03 Requirements**: Certification requirements derived and traced
- **95-00-04 Design**: Design requirements include certification constraints
- **95-00-07 V&V**: Verification activities mapped to compliance demonstration
- **95-00-11 EIS/Versions**: Configuration control for certified states
- **95-00-14 Ops/Std/Sustain**: Continuing airworthiness feedback

## Risk Management

### Certification Risks
- **Risk 1**: Delayed special condition approval for BWB
  - Mitigation: Early engagement, similarity arguments where possible
- **Risk 2**: AI certification methods not mature
  - Mitigation: Adopt conservative approach, phased introduction
- **Risk 3**: Hydrogen infrastructure not certified
  - Mitigation: Parallel ground equipment certification path
- **Risk 4**: Multi-authority coordination delays
  - Mitigation: Joint certification agreements, harmonization

## Resources and Timeline

### Team Structure
- Certification Manager
- Airworthiness Engineers (per ATA chapter)
- AI/ML Certification Specialists
- Regulatory Affairs Specialists
- Test Engineers and Pilots

### Timeline (Preliminary)
- **2025 Q1-Q2**: Certification basis definition
- **2025 Q3-Q4**: Special conditions negotiation
- **2026 Q1-Q3**: Compliance demonstration (ground testing)
- **2026 Q4 - 2027**: Flight testing and compliance closure
- **2027 Q4**: Type Certificate application
- **2028**: Type Certificate issuance (target)

## Success Criteria

Certification is considered successful when:
1. Type Certificate issued by EASA and FAA
2. All special conditions approved and complied with
3. Safety case accepted by authorities
4. Production Certificate enabling serial production
5. Continuing airworthiness framework operational
6. AI system certification enabling operational use

## Document Control
