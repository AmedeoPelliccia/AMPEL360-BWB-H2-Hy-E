# 95-00-10-01-004 [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) and Other Legal Regimes

## Document Information
- **Document ID**: 95-00-10-01-004
- **Title**: [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) and Other Legal Regimes
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Draft
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-17

## Purpose

This document addresses compliance with the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) and other legal regimes beyond traditional airworthiness certification, ensuring AMPEL360 meets all applicable legal requirements in the European Union and globally.

## EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)

### Classification
Aviation AI systems are classified as **HIGH-RISK** under Annex III (critical infrastructure).

### Requirements for High-Risk AI
1. **Risk Management System**: Systematic risk identification and mitigation
2. **Data Governance**: Quality, representativeness, bias mitigation
3. **Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive design and development records
4. **Record-Keeping**: Automatic logging of operations
5. **Transparency**: Information to users and authorities
6. **Human Oversight**: Meaningful human control
7. **Accuracy, Robustness, Cybersecurity**: Technical requirements

### AMPEL360 Compliance Strategy
- Integrate EU AI Act requirements into certification basis
- Leverage [DO-178C](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials)/[DO-254](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials) compliance for technical documentation
- DPP blockchain provides record-keeping infrastructure
- CAOS design includes human oversight by default

### Conformity Assessment
- Notified Body involvement required for high-risk AI
- Internal quality management system
- Technical documentation review
- EU Declaration of Conformity

## [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (General Data Protection Regulation)

### Applicability
- Flight data may contain personal information
- Passenger data in CAOS systems
- Employee data in training datasets

### Compliance Measures
- Data minimization in AI training
- Anonymization and pseudonymization
- Right to explanation for AI decisions affecting individuals
- Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

## [eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) (Electronic Identification and Trust Services)

### Relevance to AMPEL360
- Digital signatures for certification documents
- Blockchain-based evidence requires [eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) compliance
- Trust services for DPP

### Implementation
- Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) for document approval
- Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSP) for DPP
- [eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation)-compliant smart contract signatures

## Product Liability and Safety

### EU Product Liability Directive
- Manufacturer liability for defective products
- AI systems as products
- Burden of proof considerations

### AMPEL360 Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive safety case
- Product liability insurance
- Clear documentation of known limitations

## Environmental Regulations

### ICAO Annex 16
- Aircraft emissions standards
- Hydrogen (H₂O) emissions compliance

### EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
- Carbon-negative operation provides credits
- CO₂ capture documentation

## Export Controls and Dual-Use

### AI and Dual-Use Goods Regulation
- Advanced AI may be subject to export controls
- Compliance with EU Dual-Use Regulation

### AMPEL360 Approach
- Classification review for CAOS AI
- Export license if required
- Technology transfer controls

## Intellectual Property

### Patents and Trade Secrets
- AI model architectures may be patentable
- Training data as trade secret
- Open source considerations

### AMPEL360 IP Strategy
- Patent key innovations (BWB, H₂ integration, AI)
- Protect training data and model weights
- Open source non-critical components (community engagement)

## International Harmonization

### OECD AI Principles
- Align with OECD framework for AI
- International best practices

### ISO/IEC Standards
- ISO/IEC 42001: AI Management System
- ISO/IEC 23053: Framework for AI systems using ML

## Compliance Timeline

- **2025 Q3**: EU AI Act compliance assessment
- **2025 Q4**: [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) DPIA for AI systems
- **2026 Q1**: eIDAS integration for DPP
- **2026 Q2**: Conformity assessment preparation
- **2027**: EU AI Act conformity declaration
