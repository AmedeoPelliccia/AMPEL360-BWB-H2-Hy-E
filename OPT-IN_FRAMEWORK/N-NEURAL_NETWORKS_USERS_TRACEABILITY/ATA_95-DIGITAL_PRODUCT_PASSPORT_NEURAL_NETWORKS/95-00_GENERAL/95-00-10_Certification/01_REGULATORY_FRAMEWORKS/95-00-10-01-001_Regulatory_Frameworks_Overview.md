# 95-00-10-01-001 Regulatory Frameworks Overview

## Document Information
- **Document ID**: 95-00-10-01-001
- **Title**: Regulatory Frameworks Overview
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Draft
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-17

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the regulatory frameworks applicable to the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft certification, establishing the foundation for regulatory compliance strategy across EASA, FAA, and EU jurisdictions.

## Regulatory Landscape

### Primary Certification Authorities

**EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency)**
- Lead authority for Type Certificate
- Responsible for EU market access
- Novel technologies require special conditions
- AI Roadmap 2.0 guidance applicable

**FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)**
- Co-lead authority for US market access
- Harmonized standards where possible
- AI Assurance Framework applicable
- Hydrogen propulsion requires policy guidance

### Regulatory Domains

1. **Airworthiness (Type Certification)**
   - CS-25 / FAR Part 25 - Large Aeroplanes
   - Special Conditions for BWB, H₂, AI
   
2. **AI/ML Systems**
   - EASA AI Roadmap 2.0
   - FAA AI Assurance Framework
   - EU AI Act compliance

3. **Alternative Propulsion**
   - Hydrogen-specific standards (in development)
   - Safety and environmental considerations

4. **Digital Technologies**
   - DPP blockchain acceptance
   - Cybersecurity (DO-326A, DO-356A)

## Certification Basis Structure

The certification basis consists of:
- Applicable regulations (CS-25, Part 25)
- Special Conditions (BWB, H₂, AI)
- Equivalent Levels of Safety (where applicable)
- Methods of Compliance (analysis, test, simulation)
- Industry standards (DO-178C, DO-254, ARP4754A)

## Key Regulatory Challenges

1. **Novel Configuration (BWB)**
   - No direct precedent in commercial aviation
   - Emergency evacuation considerations
   - Structural certification approach

2. **Hydrogen Propulsion**
   - Limited regulatory guidance
   - Safety case development
   - Ground handling interface

3. **AI/Neural Networks**
   - Non-deterministic behavior
   - Learning assurance
   - Runtime monitoring requirements

4. **Digital Product Passport**
   - Regulatory acceptance of blockchain evidence
   - Data integrity and auditability

## Harmonization Strategy

AMPEL360 pursues harmonized EASA/FAA certification wherever possible:
- Joint certification basis discussions
- Coordinated special conditions
- Unified compliance demonstrations
- Simultaneous Type Certificate issuance target

## Timeline and Milestones

- **2025 Q2**: Regulatory framework analysis complete
- **2025 Q3**: Initial certification basis proposal
- **2025 Q4**: Special conditions negotiations begin
- **2026 Q2**: Certification basis approved
- **2027 Q4**: Compliance demonstrations complete
- **2028**: Type Certificate issuance
