## Lifecycle Dependencies and Interactions

### Sequential Dependencies
- Phases 01→02→03: Regulatory basis must be established before compliance planning
- Phases 04→05: Evidence structure must exist before safety case development
- Phases 06→07→08: SW/HW cert precedes ML-specific cert, both precede testing
- Phases 09→10: Internal audits should precede authority submissions
- Phase 11 depends on Phase 10: TC issuance triggers continuing airworthiness

### Parallel Activities
- Phase 00 (META): Runs in parallel with all other phases
- Phase 04 (Evidence): Continuous activity starting mid-lifecycle
- Phase 13 (DPP): Infrastructure and ongoing recording parallel to all phases
- Phase 14 (Packaging): Preparation starts early, execution late

### Feedback Loops
- Phase 09 findings → Phase 06/07 process improvements
- Phase 11 in-service data → Phase 12 change control triggers
- Phase 10 authority questions → Phase 05 safety case refinements
- Phase 13 DPP analytics → Phase 11 continuing airworthiness insights
