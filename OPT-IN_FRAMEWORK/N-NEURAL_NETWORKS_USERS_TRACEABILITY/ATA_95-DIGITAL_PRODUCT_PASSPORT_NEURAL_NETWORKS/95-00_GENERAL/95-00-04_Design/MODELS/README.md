# MODELS - Architectural and System Models

**Purpose**: This directory contains formal architectural models for the DPP+NN system using industry-standard modeling languages.

## Contents

### SysML/
Systems Modeling Language artifacts:
- Block definition diagrams (BDD)
- Internal block diagrams (IBD)
- Requirements diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- State machine diagrams

Tools: Cameo Systems Modeler, MagicDraw, Papyrus

### UML/
Unified Modeling Language artifacts:
- Class diagrams (software architecture)
- Component diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
- Use case diagrams
- Interaction diagrams

Tools: Enterprise Architect, StarUML, PlantUML

### MBSE_Integration/
Model-Based Systems Engineering integration:
- SysML-Simulink bridges
- Requirements traceability models
- Interface definition files
- Model exchange formats (XMI, OSLC)

## Modeling Standards

- **ISO/IEC 19514**: SysML v1.6 or v2.0
- **OMG UML**: UML 2.5.1
- **ARP4754A**: System development processes
- **DO-331**: Model-Based Development and Verification

## Model Traceability

All models must link to:
- Requirements (95-00-03_Requirements)
- Design assemblies (ASSETS/ASSEMBLIES)
- Verification artifacts (95-00-07_V_AND_V)

## Document Control

- **Owner**: AMPEL360 Systems Architecture WG
- **Status**: Active development
