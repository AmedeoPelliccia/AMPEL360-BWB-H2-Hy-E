# 95-00-02-004 — Safety Cases and Arguments Using DPP

## 1. Purpose

This document explains how the **Neural Network Digital Product Passport (DPP)**
is used as **evidence** in **safety cases** and **assurance arguments**.

It defines:

- The role of DPP content in structured safety argumentation (e.g., Goal Structuring Notation, Claims-Arguments-Evidence).
- How DPP entries support top-level safety claims.
- Consistency and completeness checks between DPP and safety case artefacts.

---

## 2. Overview of Safety Cases

A **safety case** is a structured argument that demonstrates a system is acceptably safe to operate.

Key components:

- **Claims / Goals:** High-level safety objectives (e.g., "System X is safe to operate in conditions Y").
- **Arguments / Strategies:** Decomposition of goals into sub-goals, supported by rationale.
- **Evidence:** Data, test results, analyses, and documentation that substantiate claims.

The **DPP** provides **traceable, version-controlled evidence** for claims related to NN components.

## 3. DPP as Evidence in Safety Cases

### 3.1 Top-Level Safety Claims

Examples of top-level claims supported by DPP:

- **Claim C1:** "The NN-based object detection system operates safely within its ODD."
  - **Evidence:** DPP references to ODD definition, validation test results, runtime monitoring data.

- **Claim C2:** "Failure of the NN component does not lead to catastrophic outcomes."
  - **Evidence:** DPP documentation of fallback modes, fail-safe logic, and fault injection test results.

- **Claim C3:** "The NN system is monitored for anomalies and performance drift."
  - **Evidence:** DPP links to monitoring KPIs, alert thresholds, and operational logs.

### 3.2 Evidence Decomposition

DPP entries can be decomposed to support sub-claims:

```
Goal G1: NN system is acceptably safe
  ├─ Strategy S1: Argument over development lifecycle
  │   ├─ Goal G1.1: Training data is appropriate
  │   │   └─ Evidence E1.1: DPP reference to ATA 96 data passport
  │   ├─ Goal G1.2: Model is validated against safety requirements
  │   │   └─ Evidence E1.2: DPP link to V&V test reports (ATA 95-00-07)
  ├─ Strategy S2: Argument over operational safety
      ├─ Goal G2.1: Runtime monitoring detects anomalies
      │   └─ Evidence E2.1: DPP monitoring plan and alert thresholds
      ├─ Goal G2.2: System fails safe
          └─ Evidence E2.2: DPP fallback mode documentation
```

## 4. Consistency Between DPP and Safety Case

### 4.1 Traceability Matrix

A traceability matrix shall map:

- Safety case **goals** ↔ DPP **evidence entries**.
- Safety case **claims** ↔ DPP **fields** (ODD, limitations, monitoring, etc.).

This ensures:

- All safety claims are substantiated by DPP evidence.
- All DPP entries are linked to safety objectives (preventing orphaned data).

### 4.2 Configuration Control

- Changes to NN components (e.g., retraining, parameter updates) may invalidate safety case arguments.
- DPP version control enables **impact analysis**:
  - Which safety claims are affected by a DPP change?
  - Does the change require re-validation or re-approval?

### 4.3 Completeness and Coverage

The DPP shall provide evidence for **all** safety-critical aspects of the NN:

- **Completeness:** No safety claim lacks supporting DPP evidence.
- **Coverage:** All hazards, failure modes, and risk controls are documented in the DPP.

---

## 5. Safety Case Presentation

When presenting the safety case to regulators or certification authorities:

- **Reference DPP entries explicitly** (by ID, version, and field).
- **Provide summaries** of DPP content in the safety case document (e.g., excerpts of ODD, validation results).
- **Ensure auditability:** DPP records must be accessible for inspection and audit.

## 6. Example: GSN-Style Safety Argument

**Goal Structuring Notation (GSN)** is a common framework for safety cases.

Example fragment:

```
[G1: NN object detection is safe]
  │
  ├─[Strategy: Argument by decomposition over lifecycle]
  │   │
  │   ├─[G1.1: Training is appropriate]
  │   │   └─[Evidence: DPP → ATA 96 data passport, training logs]
  │   │
  │   ├─[G1.2: Model is validated]
  │   │   └─[Evidence: DPP → V&V test reports, performance metrics]
  │   │
  │   ├─[G1.3: Deployment constraints are met]
  │       └─[Evidence: DPP → ODD, input constraints, deployment checklist]
  │
  ├─[Strategy: Argument by operational monitoring]
      │
      ├─[G2.1: Anomalies are detected]
      │   └─[Evidence: DPP → monitoring KPIs, alert thresholds]
      │
      ├─[G2.2: Fallback is effective]
          └─[Evidence: DPP → fallback mode description, test results]
```
