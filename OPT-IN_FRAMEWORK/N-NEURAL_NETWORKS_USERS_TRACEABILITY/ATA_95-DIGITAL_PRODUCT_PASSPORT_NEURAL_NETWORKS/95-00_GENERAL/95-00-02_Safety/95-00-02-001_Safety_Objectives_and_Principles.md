# 95-00-02-001 — Safety Objectives and Principles

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **safety objectives and principles** that guide the
Digital Product Passport (DPP) for Neural Networks under ATA 95.

It establishes:

- High-level safety goals for NN-enabled systems.
- Alignment with overall safety policy and regulatory frameworks (e.g., AMC 20-170, EASA AI Roadmap).
- Core principles that DPP content must support to enable safe deployment and operation.

## 2. Safety Objectives

The NN DPP shall support the following safety objectives:

### 2.1 No Degradation vs. Baseline

- NN-enabled functions shall not degrade overall system safety below the baseline
  (i.e., the safety level achievable without the NN component).
- DPP records must document baseline capabilities and demonstrate equivalence or improvement.

### 2.2 Bounded and Predictable Behaviour

- NN systems shall operate within defined boundaries (operational design domain, input ranges).
- DPP shall capture these boundaries and evidence that behaviour outside them is detected and managed.

### 2.3 Fail-Safe and Graceful Degradation

- When NN performance degrades or fails, the system shall transition to a safe state or fallback mode.
- DPP must document fallback strategies, monitoring triggers, and safe-mode behaviour.

### 2.4 Continuous Monitoring and Alerting

- NN systems require runtime monitoring to detect anomalies, distribution shifts, and performance drift.
- DPP shall reference monitoring mechanisms, KPIs, and alerting thresholds.

### 2.5 Explainability and Auditability

- Safety-critical NN decisions must be sufficiently explainable to support investigation and certification.
- DPP shall link to explainability artefacts, test evidence, and audit trails.

### 2.6 Learning from Safety Events

- Incidents and near-misses involving NN systems must inform updates to DPP records (new constraints, warnings, retirement).
- DPP lifecycle includes feedback loops from operational safety monitoring.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Transparency

- All safety-relevant attributes of an NN component (training data, model architecture, limitations)
  must be documented in the DPP.

### 3.2 Traceability

- DPP entries shall provide bidirectional traceability to:
  - Safety requirements and hazard analyses.
  - Test and validation evidence.
  - Operational monitoring data.

### 3.3 Configuration Control

- Changes to NN components (retraining, parameter updates) require corresponding DPP updates
  and re-approval if safety-critical.

### 3.4 Risk-Based Approach

- Level of detail and rigour in DPP content scales with the criticality and risk level of the NN function.

### 3.5 Human Oversight

- For high-risk NN functions, DPP must document the role of human supervision, override mechanisms,
  and decision authority.

## 4. Alignment with Regulatory Frameworks

This document aligns with:

- **EASA AMC 20-170** (Airworthiness and Operational Consideration for AI/ML Systems)
- **EASA AI Roadmap 2.0**
- **SAE ARP6983** (Guidance for Neural Network-Based Systems)
- **ISO/IEC 5338** (AI System Life Cycle Processes)

The DPP structure is designed to provide the evidence and traceability required
by these frameworks.
