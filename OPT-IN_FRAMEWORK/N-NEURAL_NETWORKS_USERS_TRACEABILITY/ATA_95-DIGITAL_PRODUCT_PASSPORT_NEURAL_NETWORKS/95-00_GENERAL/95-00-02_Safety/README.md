# 95-00-02_Safety — Digital Product Passport Safety View for Neural Networks

## 1. Purpose

This folder defines the **safety-related aspects** of the
**Digital Product Passport (DPP) for Neural Networks** under **ATA 95**.

It explains how the DPP:

- Supports **safety objectives and principles** for NN-enabled functions.
- Provides **structured evidence** for safety cases and certification.
- Connects DPP records to **hazard analysis**, **risk controls** and
  **operational monitoring**.
- Enables **learning from safety events** and controlled evolution of
  NN deployments (limitations, restrictions, decommissioning).

---

## 2. Scope

The 95-00-02_Safety layer covers:

- Safety objectives and principles that the NN DPP must support.
- Safety-driven **requirements on DPP content** (fields, metadata, links).
- The interface between DPP records and:
  - Hazard logs, FHA/FMEA/FTA, bow-tie analyses.
  - Safety cases / assurance cases.
  - Operational monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
- How safety incidents and lessons learned are reflected in the DPP
  (status changes, new warnings, constraints, or retirement).

It does **not** define the full hazard analysis process itself (which is
handled by project safety processes) but specifies how the DPP must
**expose and track safety-relevant information** about NN artefacts and
deployments.

Suggested roles:

* **95-00-02-001_Safety_Objectives_and_Principles.md**
  Defines safety objectives for NN DPP and alignment with overall safety policy.

* **95-00-02-002_Safety_Requirements_for_DPP_Content.md**
  Lists DPP fields and links that are required to support safety assurance
  (e.g. operating envelope, fail-safe behaviour, monitoring hooks, fallback).

* **95-00-02-003_Hazard_Analysis_and_DPP_Linkage.md**
  Describes how each DPP instance is connected to specific hazards, causes,
  controls and safety requirements in the hazard / risk tools.

* **95-00-02-004_Safety_Cases_and_Arguments_Using_DPP.md**
  Explains how DPP content contributes as **evidence** in safety cases and
  how consistency with other artefacts is maintained.

* **95-00-02-005_Failure_Modes_and_Risk_Controls_for_NN_Systems.md**
  Catalogues NN-specific failure modes and required DPP data to describe
  risk controls, mitigations and operational constraints.

* **95-00-02-006_Operational_Safety_Monitoring_and_Alerts.md**
  Maps safety monitoring requirements (KPIs, triggers, thresholds) into
  DPP fields and references.

* **95-00-02-007_Safety_Incidents_Learning_and_DPP_Updates.md**
  Defines how incidents/occurrences lead to updates in DPP entries, including
  additional warnings, changed status, or retirement flags.

* **95-00-02-008_Limitations_Assumptions_and_Residual_Risk.md**
  Documents what the DPP safety view can and cannot represent, explicit
  assumptions and remaining risk.

## 4. Relationship with Other Sections

* **95-00-01_Overview**
  Provides the general DPP concept; 95-00-02_Safety specialises it for
  **safety-related usage and evidence**.

* **95-xx-xx Schema / Implementation**
  Technical schema documents will define actual field names, data types and
  interfaces corresponding to the safety requirements stated here.

* **Other Safety / Certification Artefacts**
  This section is designed to align with:

  * Hazard logs and risk registers.
  * Safety cases and assurance frameworks.
  * Operational safety monitoring and occurrence reporting processes.

---

## 5. Usage

* Use this folder as the **reference** when:

  * Defining safety-relevant DPP fields and constraints.
  * Mapping NN safety analyses into DPP records.
  * Explaining to safety / certification stakeholders how the DPP supports
    safety assurance and monitoring.

* Any change to safety objectives, requirements or processes that affects
  DPP content must be reflected in the relevant `95-00-02-xxx_*.md` files
  and captured in ATA 95 change control.
