# 95-00-02-002 — Safety Requirements for DPP Content

## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the **safety-driven requirements** for the content of the
Neural Network Digital Product Passport (DPP).

It defines:

- Mandatory fields and metadata that must exist in the DPP to support safety assurance.
- Links and references to external safety artefacts.
- Data quality and traceability requirements for safety-critical NN components.

---

## 2. Mandatory DPP Fields for Safety

The following fields are **required** in the DPP for any NN component involved in
safety-critical functions:

### 2.1 Identification and Version

- **NN Component ID:** Unique identifier (UUID or equivalent).
- **Version / Revision:** Semantic version or hash of the trained model.
- **Training Date / Timestamp:** When the model was trained or last retrained.

### 2.2 Operating Envelope

- **Operational Design Domain (ODD):** Conditions under which the NN is validated to operate safely.
- **Input Constraints:** Ranges, distributions, and quality requirements for input data.
- **Output Boundaries:** Expected ranges and confidence thresholds for outputs.

### 2.3 Limitations and Exclusions

- **Known Limitations:** Documented scenarios, edge cases, or conditions where the NN may not perform safely.
- **Out-of-Scope Conditions:** Explicit list of conditions where the NN must not be used.

### 2.4 Fail-Safe and Fallback Mechanisms

- **Fallback Mode Description:** What happens when the NN cannot provide a safe output.
- **Detection Mechanisms:** How anomalies, out-of-distribution inputs, or performance degradation are detected.
- **Safe-State Transitions:** Procedures for transitioning to a safe state or manual control.

### 2.5 Monitoring and Alerting Hooks

- **Runtime Monitoring Requirements:** KPIs, metrics, and thresholds that must be monitored during operation.
- **Alert Triggers:** Conditions that generate alerts or require human intervention.
- **Logging and Audit Trail:** Data to be logged for post-incident analysis.

### 2.6 Explainability Artefacts

- **Explainability Method:** Technique used (SHAP, LIME, attention maps, etc.).
- **Links to Artefacts:** References to stored explanations, saliency maps, or decision reports.

### 2.7 Training and Validation Evidence

- **Training Data Pedigree:** Reference to ATA 96 data passport or equivalent.
- **Validation Results:** Summary of test performance, confusion matrices, edge case testing.
- **Links to Test Reports:** Pointers to detailed validation and V&V documentation (ATA 95-00-07).

## 3. Links to External Safety Artefacts

The DPP must provide **traceable references** to:

- **Hazard Log / Risk Register:** Specific hazard IDs addressed by the NN component.
- **Safety Requirements:** IDs of safety requirements allocated to the NN.
- **Safety Cases / Assurance Cases:** Links to GSN-style argument structures.
- **FHA / FMEA / FTA:** Functional hazard analyses and fault tree analyses involving the NN.
- **Certification Artefacts:** Compliance matrices, test plans, certification reports.

---

## 4. Data Quality and Traceability

### 4.1 Data Provenance

- All DPP entries must include metadata on the source, authorship, and approval status.
- Changes to DPP records must be version-controlled and auditable.

### 4.2 Integrity and Tamper-Evidence

- DPP data should be protected against unauthorised modification.
- Use of cryptographic signatures or blockchain-based immutability is recommended for high-criticality systems.

### 4.3 Retention and Archival

- DPP records for safety-critical NN components must be retained for the operational lifetime
  of the aircraft plus applicable regulatory retention periods.

## 5. Risk-Based Tailoring

- The level of detail and rigour in DPP content **scales with the safety criticality** of the NN function:
  - **DAL A (Catastrophic):** Full DPP with all mandatory fields and exhaustive traceability.
  - **DAL B–C:** Reduced set of fields, risk-based sampling of evidence.
  - **DAL D–E (Non-safety-critical):** Minimal DPP, focus on operational monitoring.
