# 95-00-02-003 — Hazard Analysis and DPP Linkage

## 1. Purpose

This document describes how **Neural Network Digital Product Passport (DPP)** entries
are linked to **hazard analysis processes** and risk management artefacts.

It defines:

- The interface between DPP records and hazard logs, FMEA, FHA, FTA, and bow-tie analyses.
- Traceability requirements from NN components to hazards and risk controls.
- How DPP updates are triggered by changes in hazard or risk status.

---

## 2. Overview of Hazard Analysis Integration

NN components, like any system element, must be analysed for their contribution to system-level hazards:

- **Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA):** Identifies system-level failures and their effects.
- **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** Identifies component-level failure modes.
- **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA):** Decomposes hazards into contributing faults.
- **Bow-Tie Analysis:** Maps threats → hazard event → consequences, with barriers/controls.

The **DPP** acts as a **data source** that:

- Documents the capabilities, limitations, and failure modes of NN components.
- References hazards and risk controls applicable to the NN.
- Provides evidence that safety requirements derived from hazard analyses are met.

---

## 3. DPP-to-Hazard Linkage

### 3.1 Hazard References in DPP

Each DPP entry for a safety-critical NN component shall include:

- **Hazard IDs:** List of hazard log entries or risk register IDs that the NN component contributes to or mitigates.
- **Safety Requirements Allocation:** IDs of derived safety requirements assigned to the NN.
- **Failure Mode Tags:** Specific failure modes (from FMEA) that the NN may exhibit.

**Example:**

```yaml
hazard_links:
  - hazard_id: HAZ-123
    description: "False positive in object detection leading to incorrect avoidance manoeuvre"
    severity: Major
    likelihood: Remote
  - hazard_id: HAZ-456
    description: "NN performance degradation due to sensor noise"
    severity: Minor
    likelihood: Probable
```

### 3.2 Risk Controls and Mitigations

For each linked hazard, the DPP shall document:

- **Controls / Mitigations:** Design features, runtime monitors, or fallback mechanisms that reduce risk.
- **Verification Evidence:** Links to test reports, validation results, or monitoring data demonstrating effectiveness.

---

## 4. Traceability to Hazard Analysis Artefacts

The DPP must provide **bidirectional traceability**:

- **Forward:** From NN component → Hazards → Safety Requirements → Verification Evidence.
- **Backward:** From Hazard / Risk Control → NN Components implementing the control.

This enables:

- Impact analysis when NN components are updated.
- Demonstration of completeness in safety cases.
- Audit and certification support.

---

## 5. DPP Update Triggers from Hazard Changes

Changes in hazard status or risk assessment may require DPP updates:

| Trigger Event                          | DPP Update Action                                           |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| New hazard identified involving NN     | Add hazard reference to DPP, update risk controls          |
| Severity/likelihood re-assessed        | Update risk level metadata in DPP                          |
| New mitigation or control introduced   | Document control in DPP, link to verification evidence     |
| NN failure mode observed in operation  | Update failure mode list, adjust monitoring thresholds     |
| Hazard retired or closed               | Mark hazard link as resolved, archive supporting evidence  |

---

## 6. Hazard Log / Risk Register Interface

The DPP system should interface with the project hazard log / risk register:

- **Pull:** DPP queries the hazard log to populate hazard references and risk levels.
- **Push:** DPP notifies hazard log when NN component status changes (e.g., degradation, decommissioned).

This may be implemented via:

- RESTful APIs.
- Shared databases or data lakes.
- Regular export/import cycles with human review.

---

## 7. Example: Bow-Tie Integration

In a bow-tie analysis:

- **Threats** (left side): NN training data corruption, sensor failures, adversarial inputs.
- **Hazard Event** (centre): NN provides incorrect output.
- **Consequences** (right side): Loss of separation, collision, etc.
- **Barriers** (controls): Input validation, runtime monitoring, fallback logic.

The DPP:

- Documents which NN components are part of which barriers.
- Provides evidence that barriers are effective (test results, monitoring data).
- Links to the bow-tie diagram ID and risk assessment.
