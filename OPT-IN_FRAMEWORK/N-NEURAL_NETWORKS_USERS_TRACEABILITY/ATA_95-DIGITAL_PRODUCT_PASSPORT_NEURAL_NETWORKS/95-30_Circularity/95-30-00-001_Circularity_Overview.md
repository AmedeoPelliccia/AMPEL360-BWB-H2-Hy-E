# 95-30-00-001 Circularity Overview

**Document ID:** 95-30-00-001  
**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E circularity framework, establishing the foundation for circular economy principles across all aircraft systems.

## 2. Circularity Vision

The AMPEL360 aircraft is designed with circularity at its core, going beyond zero-emission to achieve carbon-negative flight operations through:

- **Closed-loop systems**: Maximize resource reuse and minimize waste
- **Energy recovery**: Capture and reuse waste heat and energy across systems
- **Material lifecycle management**: Design for disassembly, reuse, and recycling
- **Digital traceability**: Complete lifecycle tracking through Digital Product Passport

## 3. Key Principles

### 3.1 Design for Circularity
- Modular architecture enabling component-level maintenance and upgrade
- Standardized interfaces for easy disassembly
- Material selection prioritizing recyclability and renewability

### 3.2 Operational Circularity
- Energy recovery loops across propulsion, environmental, and electrical systems
- Fluid management systems with minimal loss and maximum reuse
- Predictive maintenance reducing premature component replacement

### 3.3 End-of-Life Circularity
- Component refurbishment and second-life applications
- Material recovery and recycling processes
- Cradle-to-cradle material flows

## 4. Cross-ATA Integration

Circularity is implemented across multiple ATA chapters, with specific focus on:

| ATA Chapter | System | Circularity Focus |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| ATA 21 | Environmental Control | Air quality loops, thermal recovery, filter reuse |
| ATA 24 | Electrical Power | Load optimization, power recovery, redundancy |
| ATA 28 | Fuel (H₂) | Boil-off management, return loops, minimal venting |
| ATA 29 | Hydraulic | Fluid loops, accumulator use, leak prevention |
| ATA 36 | Pneumatic | Bleed air reuse, pressure regulation, heat recovery |
| ATA 38 | Water/Waste | Water reclamation, treatment loops, ground interfaces |
| ATA 49 | APU | Energy recovery, emissions minimization, resource sharing |
| ATA 70 | Propulsion | Thermal recovery, fuel interface, energy design |
| ATA 80 | Energy Storage | Battery lifecycle, charge/discharge optimization, second life |

## 5. Digital Product Passport Integration

Each circular loop and component is tracked through the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system, providing:

- Real-time monitoring of resource flows
- Lifecycle tracking from manufacturing to end-of-life
- Performance metrics for circular efficiency
- Regulatory compliance documentation

## 6. Key Performance Indicators

### 6.1 System-Level KPIs
- **Energy Recovery Rate**: Percentage of waste energy captured and reused
- **Material Circularity Index**: Measure of material reuse vs. virgin material input
- **Fluid Loss Rate**: Percentage of hydraulic, pneumatic, and water system losses
- **Component Reuse Rate**: Percentage of components entering second life vs. recycling

### 6.2 Aircraft-Level KPIs
- **Overall Circularity Score**: Composite metric of all circular economy measures
- **Carbon Negativity**: Net CO₂ removed per flight (target: -5 kg)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Total resource input vs. useful output

## 7. Regulatory Framework

Circularity implementation aligns with:
- EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)
- EU Digital Product Passport requirements
- EASA sustainability guidelines
- ISO 14040/14044 Life Cycle Assessment standards
