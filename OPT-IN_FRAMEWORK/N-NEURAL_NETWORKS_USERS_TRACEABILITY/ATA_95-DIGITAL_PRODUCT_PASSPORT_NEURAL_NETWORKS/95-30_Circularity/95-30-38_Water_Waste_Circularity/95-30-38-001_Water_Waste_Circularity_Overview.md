# 95-30-38-001 Water_Waste Circularity Overview

**Document ID:** 95-30-38-001  
**ATA Chapter:** 38 - Water/Waste  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-17  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Water/Waste in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Water/Waste plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on water reclamation, treatment loops, ground interfaces.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Grey Water Treatment: 88% recovery target
- **Objective 2**: Fuel Cell Water → Potable: 95% conversion
- **Objective 3**: Water Balance: <10L fresh water per flight

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Water/Waste circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-70 (Propulsion)
- ATA-21 (ECS)
- Ground Systems

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-007: Water Recovery Rate
- KPI-019: Water Footprint per Flight

## 6. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Design (2024-2025)
- Define circular design requirements
- Establish interface specifications
- Develop control strategies

### Phase 2: Development (2026-2027)
- Prototype testing and validation
- System integration
- Performance verification

### Phase 3: Certification (2028)
- Regulatory compliance demonstration
- Flight testing
- Documentation finalization

### Phase 4: Operations (2029+)
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Maintenance refinement
- Performance improvement
