**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Electrical Power in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Electrical Power plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on load optimization, power recovery, redundancy management.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Regenerative Braking Recovery: 85% efficiency target
- **Objective 2**: Load Sharing Optimization: Balance factor <0.15
- **Objective 3**: Redundant Path Management: Minimize losses

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Electrical Power circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-80 (Energy Storage)
- ATA-49 (APU)
- ATA-32 (Landing Gear)

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-003: Electrical Regeneration Efficiency
- KPI-010: Electrical Load Balance Factor
