**Document ID:** 95-30-29-001  
**ATA Chapter:** 29 - Hydraulic Power  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-17  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Hydraulic Power in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Hydraulic Power plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on fluid loops, accumulator usage, leak prevention.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Hydraulic Energy Recovery: 80% efficiency target
- **Objective 2**: Accumulator Management: Optimize charge/discharge
- **Objective 3**: Leak Prevention: <1% fluid loss

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Hydraulic Power circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-32 (Landing Gear)
- ATA-27 (Flight Controls)

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-004: Hydraulic Energy Recovery Rate
- KPI-006: Hydraulic Fluid Loss Rate

## 6. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Design (2024-2025)
- Define circular design requirements
