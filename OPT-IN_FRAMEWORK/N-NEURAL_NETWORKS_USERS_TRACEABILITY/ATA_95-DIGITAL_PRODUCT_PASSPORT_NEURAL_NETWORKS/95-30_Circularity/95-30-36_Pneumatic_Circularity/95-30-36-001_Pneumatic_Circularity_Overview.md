## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Pneumatic in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Pneumatic plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on bleed air reuse, pressure regulation, heat recovery.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Bleed Air Optimization: 85% efficiency target
- **Objective 2**: Heat Recovery from Pneumatics: 60% recovery
- **Objective 3**: Pressure Regulation Efficiency: Minimize losses

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Pneumatic circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-21 (ECS)
- ATA-70 (Propulsion)

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-011: Pneumatic Pressure Regulation Efficiency
