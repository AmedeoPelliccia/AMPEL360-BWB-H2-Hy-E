**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Energy Storage in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Energy Storage plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on battery lifecycle, charge/discharge optimization, second life.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Battery Cycle Optimization: 100%+ design life
- **Objective 2**: CO₂ Battery Operation: -5kg CO₂ per flight
- **Objective 3**: Second-Life Applications: 60% component reuse

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Energy Storage circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-24 (Electrical)
- ATA-70 (Propulsion)
- ATA-95 (DPP)

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-014: Battery Cycle Efficiency
- KPI-017: Net CO₂ per Flight

## 6. Implementation Phases
