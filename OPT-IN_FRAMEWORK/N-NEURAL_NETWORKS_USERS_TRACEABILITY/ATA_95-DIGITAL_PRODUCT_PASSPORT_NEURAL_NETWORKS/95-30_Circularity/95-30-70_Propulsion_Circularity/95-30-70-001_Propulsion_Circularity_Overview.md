**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of circularity principles and implementations for the Propulsion in the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. System Description

The Propulsion plays a critical role in the overall aircraft circularity strategy by focusing on thermal recovery, fuel interface, energy design.

## 3. Circularity Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Fuel Cell Waste Heat Recovery: 72% efficiency
- **Objective 2**: CO₂ Capture from Exhaust: 98% capture rate
- **Objective 3**: Water Byproduct Collection: 99% collection

### 3.2 Cross-System Integration

The Propulsion circularity implementation interfaces with:
- ATA-21 (ECS)
- ATA-80 (CO₂ Battery)
- ATA-28 (Fuel)

## 4. Circular Loops Overview

### 4.1 Material Flows
The system manages material flows to minimize waste and maximize reuse through closed-loop designs.

### 4.2 Energy Flows
Energy recovery and optimization are implemented throughout the system to minimize overall aircraft energy consumption.

### 4.3 Information Flows
All circularity data is captured in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) for lifecycle tracking and optimization.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

- KPI-002: Thermal Recovery
- KPI-018: Total Energy Efficiency
