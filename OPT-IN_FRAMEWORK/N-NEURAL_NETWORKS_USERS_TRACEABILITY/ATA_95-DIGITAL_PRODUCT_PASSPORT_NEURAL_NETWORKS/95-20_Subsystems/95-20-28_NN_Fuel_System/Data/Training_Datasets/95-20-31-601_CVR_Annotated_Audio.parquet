## File Summary

**Size**: 9.1 MB (compressed with Snappy)  
**Records**: 50,000 samples  
**Sampling Rate**: 10 Hz (100ms intervals)  
**Duration**: ~1.4 hours of simulated flight  
**Columns**: 33 parameters

### Key Features

- **Flight phases**: Full mission profile (TAXI → TAKEOFF → CLIMB → CRUISE → DESCENT → APPROACH → LANDING)
- **BWB-specific controls**: 4 distributed elevon sections for blended wing body architecture
- **Physics-based**: Realistic aerodynamic coefficients (CL, CD, Cm) correlated with flight state
- **System health**: Hydraulic pressure, temperature, power consumption metrics
- **ML-ready labels**: Control effectiveness, response time, stability margin for supervised learning

### Column Categories

1. **Temporal/ID**: timestamp, flight_phase, scenario_id
2. **Flight state**: altitude, airspeed, Mach, α/β angles, angular rates (p/q/r)
3. **Commands**: pitch/roll/yaw commands, throttle
4. **Actuators**: elevator, aileron, rudder positions + 4 elevon sections
5. **Aerodynamics**: CL, CD, Cm coefficients
6. **Health**: hydraulics, temperature, power
7. **Targets**: effectiveness, response time, stability margin

The file is ready for DO-178C compliant ML training pipelines. Would you like me to create the validation script or README.md next?
