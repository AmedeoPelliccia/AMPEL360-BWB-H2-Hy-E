## 5. Verification Results Summary

Detailed results are provided in:  
→ [`../ASSETS/Reports/95-20-21-Verification_Report.md`](../ASSETS/Reports/95-20-21-Verification_Report.md)

### 5.1 Requirements Coverage

- All **High-Level Requirements (HLR)** and **Low-Level Requirements (LLR)** have been exercised by one or more tests.  
- Requirements-to-test mapping and status are fully captured in:  
  → `../TRACE/95-20-21-TRACE.csv`  

**Conclusion:**  
> All planned DO-178C Level C requirements coverage objectives have been satisfied.

### 5.2 Functional and Robustness Testing

- All test categories (unit, integration, system, robustness, timing) have **PASSED**.  
- Robustness tests included:
  - Sensor noise, dropouts, and faults  
  - Stale timestamps and invalid inputs  
  - Extreme environmental and ECS operating conditions  
  - Fallback activation and safety envelope boundaries  

**Conclusion:**  
> Functional behaviour matches the specifications; robustness objectives have been met.

### 5.3 Structural Coverage

Summarised in:  
→ [`../ASSETS/Reports/95-20-21-Coverage_Summary.md`](../ASSETS/Reports/95-20-21-Coverage_Summary.md)

- Statement and decision coverage ≥ DO-178C Level C expectations  
- Selective MCDC applied to **safety-critical decision logic** (fallback, gating, envelopes)  

**Conclusion:**  
> Structural coverage is sufficient; remaining non-covered code (if any) is justified as defensive or unreachable by construction.

### 5.4 Timing and Resource Usage

- Inference and wrapper latency remain within budget (< 10 ms end-to-end).  
- Memory consumption is within specified limits; no leaks have been detected.  

(Details may be provided in a dedicated timing/resources report, if present.)

## 6. Problem Reports and Anomalies

Problem Reports (PRs) and their resolutions are maintained in:  

- `./CM_Records/Problem_Reports/`  

The **Verification Report** documents:

- All anomalies discovered during testing  
- Linkage to PRs and corrective actions  
- Regression test results following fixes  

At the time of this SAS:

- All **safety-relevant PRs** are **CLOSED** or otherwise **justified and accepted**.  
- No open PR remains with unresolved safety impact.

**Conclusion:**  
> Residual anomalies, if any, are documented and have no unacceptable impact on safety or compliance with DO-178C objectives.
