**Document ID**: 95-20-21-SCMP
**Applies To**: Models A-101 → A-107
**Certification Target**: **DO-178C, Level C**
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: WORKING
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-19

# **1. Purpose**

The Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP) defines how software artefacts, datasets, neural network models, documentation, and supporting tools are **identified, controlled, versioned, tracked, stored, audited, and released** for the **ECS Neural Network Subsystem (95-20-21)**.

This SCMP ensures compliance with:

* **DO-178C** (Software CM Objectives for DAL C)
* **DO-330** (Tool Qualification)
* **EASA AI Roadmap 2.0 / SC-AI**
* **FAA AI Assurance Framework**
* **ATA 95 Digital Product Passport (DPP)**
* **AMPEL360 OPT-IN documentation governance**

It applies to all NN ECS components:

| Model ID | Function                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| A-101    | Cabin Temperature Predictor |
| A-102    | Air Quality Monitor         |
| A-103    | HVAC Optimizer              |
| A-104    | Pressure Control NN         |
| A-105    | Humidity Manager            |
| A-107    | CO₂ Scrubbing Optimizer     |

# **2. Configuration Items (CIs)**

The following are **controlled Configuration Items** under this SCMP:

---

## **2.1 Source Code**

Stored under:
`Models/Source/*.py`

Includes:

* Preprocessing logic
* NN wrapper code
* Safety shell implementation
* Deterministic inference pipeline
* Model loading & validation routines

All source code changes must reference:

* Requirement ID(s)
* Traceability links
* Test cases impacted

---

## **2.2 Executable Object Code (ONNX Models)**

Stored under:
`Models/Trained/*.onnx`

Each ONNX artefact has:

* **SHA-256 hash**
* **Model Card link**
* **Training configuration link**
* **Dataset lineage link**
* **Conversion logs** (tf2onnx / torch.onnx.export)

No ONNX model is accepted unless:

* Hash is stable vs CI-calculated hash
* Structure validated via ONNX checker
* Model Card fields are complete

---

## **2.3 Datasets & Data Assets**

Stored under:

* `Data/Training_Datasets/`
* `Data/Synthetic_Data/`
* `Data/Validation/`

Every dataset requires:

* **Dataset hash**
* **Schema version**
* **DPP dataset entry**
* **Data card (metadata)**
* **Approved provenance**

Drift detection is monitored continuously by NN recording systems.

---

## **2.4 Documentation**

Documentation is version-controlled under the OPT-IN framework.

Controlled documents include:

* Architecture diagrams
* Data-flow diagrams
* Integration maps
* Model Cards
* Certification documents
* Test reports
* Traceability matrices
* Safety analyses

CI ensures all documentation:

* Has valid metadata
* Includes hyperlinks to referenced artefacts
* Mentions AI-assisted authorship triggered by *Amedeo Pelliccia*

---

## **2.5 Scripts & Tools**

Controlled tools include:

* `inspect_onnx_model.py`
* `test_onnx_model.py`
* `convert_to_onnx.py`
* Synthetic data generators
* CI automation scripts
* doc-meta-enforcer
* hyperlink-injection watchdog

These are versioned in `/tools/` and treated as configuration items.

---

# **3. Configuration Identification**

Every CI must include the following identifiers:

* **CI Name**
* **CI Type** (code, model, dataset, document, tool)
* **Semantic version**
* **Unique model ID** (A-101, A-102…)
* **Repository path**
* **Hash (if applicable)**
* **DPP entry ID**
* **Certification relevance level**

---

# **4. Change Control**

Change control is enforced by:

### **4.1 GitHub Protected Branch Model**

* **`main`** → Locked, release artifacts only
* **`certification/` branches** → Only for DO-178C artefacts
* **All changes require**:

  * Pull-request
  * Two approvals
  * Certification reviewer tag
  * CI pipeline pass
  * Model Card validation

---

### **4.2 Configuration Control Board (CCB)**

All changes affecting:

* Requirements
* ONNX outputs
* Dataset versions
* Safety envelope
* Certification evidence

must be approved by the **AMPEL360 Software CCB**, composed of:

* Chief Engineer, AI Systems
* ECS Domain Lead
* Certification Lead
* Safety Lead
* Quality Assurance Lead

---

### **4.3 Traceability Enforcement**

Traceability is maintained in:

* `TRACE/95-20-21-TRACE.csv`
* `ASSETS/Model_Cards/`
* `Certification/*`
* DPP entries

Every change must update:

* Requirement coverage
* Test coverage
* Affected model cards
* DPP lineage

---

# **5. Configuration Status Accounting**

The status of each CI is tracked via:

### **5.1 DPP (Digital Product Passport)**

A DPP entry records:

* Model lineage
* Training data lineage
* Conversion logs
* Hashes
* Certification status
* Deployment history per aircraft

### **5.2 Automated Status Reporting**

CI dashboards track:

* Current model versions
* Hash mismatches
* Dataset drift alerts
* Failing tests
* Missing hyperlinks
* Document-control violations

---

# **6. Configuration Audits**

### **6.1 Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)**

Verifies:

* All requirements satisfied
* All tests executed
* All documents present
* All ONNX outputs validated

### **6.2 Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)**

Verifies:

* All artefacts referenced actually exist
* Hashes match
* Final release bundle is internally consistent

Audits follow DO-178C objectives and are recorded in:
`Certification/Audits/95-20-21-Audit_Log.csv`

---

# **7. Release Management**

A release bundle is created under:

`cd/publications/ECS_NN_Release_x.y.z/`

Release includes:

* ONNX models
* Model Cards
* Test reports
* Safety analyses
* Certification evidence
* Hash manifest
* DPP export

Release tags follow the pattern:

```
ECS-NN-vX.Y.Z
```

---

# **8. Baselines**

Three baselines are defined:

1. **Development Baseline**
   Daily development, CI-driven.

2. **Integration Baseline**
   ECS subsystem integration testing.

3. **Certification Baseline**
   Final immutable artefacts for regulatory submission.

Certification Baseline is frozen using:

* Git tag
* Hash manifest
* DPP lock entry
* QR-coded release bundle

---

# **9. Problem Reporting**

All issues tracked in:

* GitHub Issues
* Problem Report Forms (`PR_95-20-21_*.md`)
* Linked to:

  * requirement
  * test
  * ONNX hash
  * dataset version

Resolved PRs are attached to SAS.

---

# **10. Tools & Tool Qualification**

### Tools not requiring qualification:

* Training frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* Conversion tools (tf2onnx, PyTorch ONNX exporter)
* Analysis tools (pytest, ONNX checker)

### Tools requiring validation-by-use:

* ONNX Runtime inside IMA
* Custom wrappers enforcing deterministic inference
* Data validation pipeline

---

# **11. Storage, Backup, and Retention**

All CIs are retained for **≥ 10 years** from aircraft retirement.
Backups stored in:

* AMPEL360 Secure Archive
* ECS Domain Backup Vault
* Cloud Vault (Geo-redundant)

---

# **12. Document Control**

* **Document ID**: 95-20-21-SCMP
* **Version**: 1.0
* **Status**: WORKING
