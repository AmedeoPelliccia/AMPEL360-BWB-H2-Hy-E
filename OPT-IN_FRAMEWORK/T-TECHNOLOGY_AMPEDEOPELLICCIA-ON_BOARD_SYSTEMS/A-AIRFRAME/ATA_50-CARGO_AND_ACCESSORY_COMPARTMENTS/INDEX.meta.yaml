description: |
  ATA 50 establishes the design, configuration, and operational procedures for all 
  cargo and accessory compartments on the AMPEL360 aircraft. The BWB configuration 
  enables revolutionary cargo integration within the center body structure, optimized 
  through CAOS intelligent loading systems.
