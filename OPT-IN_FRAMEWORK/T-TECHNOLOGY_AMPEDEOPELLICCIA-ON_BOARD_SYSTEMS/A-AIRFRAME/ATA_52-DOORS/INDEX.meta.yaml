  ATA 52 is a standard ATA iSpec 2200 chapter covering all aircraft doors, 
  hatches, and access panels. For AMPEL360, this chapter addresses the unique 
  BWB door placement challenges (wide 22.5m cabin), including innovative ventral 
  emergency exits for center-seat passenger evacuation, reinforced flight deck 
  security doors, and CAOS-integrated predictive door maintenance systems.
