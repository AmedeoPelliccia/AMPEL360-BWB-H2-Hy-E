## Manufacturing Processes

### Composite Fabrication
- **Layup:** Manual layup, AFP (Automated Fiber Placement)
- **Cure:** Autoclave cure cycles, OOA processing
- **Trimming:** CNC machining, waterjet cutting
- **Drilling:** Automated drilling for fastener holes
- **Assembly:** Adhesive bonding, mechanical fastening

### SHM Sensor Installation
- **Embedding:** FBG sensors embedded during layup
- **Bonding:** PZT and AE sensors surface-bonded after cure
- **Wiring:** Sensor cable routing and termination
- **Testing:** Sensor functionality verification

### Quality Control
- **Incoming Inspection:** Material lot acceptance testing
- **In-Process Inspection:** Ply orientation, fiber areal weight, cure temperature
- **Final Inspection:** Dimensional inspection, NDT (ultrasonic, thermography)
- **FAI:** First Article Inspection per AS9102

### Production Tooling
- **Layup Tools:** Composite layup molds (composite or metallic)
- **Cure Tools:** Autoclave tooling, vacuum bagging consumables
- **Assembly Fixtures:** Wing-to-body join fixture, door installation jigs
- **Inspection Tools:** CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine), laser trackers

## Production Rate Planning
- **Initial Production:** 2 aircraft/year (learning curve phase)
- **Full Rate Production:** 12 aircraft/year (stable production)
- **Build Time:** 18 months per aircraft (structure only)
- **Workforce:** 500 personnel (composite fabrication and assembly)

## Supply Chain Management

### Key Suppliers
- **Carbon Fiber:** Toray, Hexcel (prepreg material)
- **Honeycomb Core:** Hexcel, Euro-Composites (Nomex core)
- **Adhesives:** Cytec, 3M (structural adhesives)
- **SHM Sensors:** Micron Optics (FBG), PI Ceramic (PZT)
- **Fasteners:** Alcoa, Boeing Distribution (Hi-Lok, Hi-Lite)

### Supplier Management
- Supplier qualification and approval
- Material specifications and procurement
- Quality requirements and audits
- Delivery schedules and logistics

## Cost Analysis
- **Material Cost:** $8M per aircraft (composite materials, sensors, fasteners)
- **Labor Cost:** $12M per aircraft (fabrication, assembly, inspection)
- **Tooling Cost:** $50M (amortized over 100 aircraft = $500k/aircraft)
- **Total Structural Cost:** ~$20M per aircraft

## Production Readiness
- Production readiness review (PRR) checklist
- Manufacturing process validation
- Workforce training and certification
- Tooling qualification and acceptance
- Supply chain readiness assessment
