## Purpose
This folder contains safety analysis documentation for ATA 51 structural systems, including hazard analysis, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and safety assessment reports.

## Contents
- Structural safety analysis
- Damage tolerance safety assessment
- SHM system safety analysis
- Cryogenic structure safety considerations
- Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
- Fault tree analysis (FTA)
- Safety requirements allocation
- Emergency procedures for structural failures

## Key Documents
- `Structural_Safety_Assessment.md` - Overall safety analysis per CS-25.1309
- `Damage_Tolerance_Safety.md` - Safety aspects of damage tolerance philosophy
- `SHM_FMEA.md` - Failure modes for SHM system
- `Cryogenic_Hazards.md` - Safety analysis for cold-soaked structure
- `Emergency_Structural_Procedures.md` - Flight crew and maintenance emergency procedures

## Key Safety Requirements
- CS-25.1309: Equipment, systems, and installations
- CS-25.571: Damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation
