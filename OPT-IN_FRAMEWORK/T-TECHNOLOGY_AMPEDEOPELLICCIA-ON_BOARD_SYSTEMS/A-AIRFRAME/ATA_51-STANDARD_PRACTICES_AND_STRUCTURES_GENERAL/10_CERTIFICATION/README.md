## Regulatory Framework

### Primary Regulations
- **CS-25:** EASA Certification Specifications for Large Aeroplanes
- **FAA Part 25:** FAA Airworthiness Standards for Transport Category Airplanes
- **CS-25.301-307:** Loads and structural requirements
- **CS-25.571:** Damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation
- **CS-25.613:** Material strength properties
- **CS-25.1309:** Equipment, systems, and installations (for SHM)

### Certification Basis
- **Baseline:** CS-25 Amendment 27 (latest at program launch)
- **Special Conditions:** BWB configuration, composite primary structure, LH₂ integration
- **Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS):** Alternative compliance methods where needed

## Means of Compliance (MoC)

### Analysis
- FEA for load and stress analysis
- Damage tolerance analysis per CS-25.571
- Fatigue analysis for 60-year service life
- Cryogenic thermal analysis

### Testing
- Full-scale static test to ultimate load
- Full-scale fatigue test to 2× design life
- Material property testing per CMH-17
- Impact damage testing (BVID, detectable damage)
- Cryogenic thermal cycling tests
- SHM system functionality tests

### Inspection
- Production quality control inspections
- First Article Inspection (FAI)
- Conformity inspections
- Continued airworthiness inspections

## Certification Milestones
- **Certification Plan Approval:** Program Month 12
- **Material Qualification:** PM 24
- **Component Tests Complete:** PM 36
- **Full-Scale Static Test:** PM 48
- **Full-Scale Fatigue Test Start:** PM 48 (duration: 24 months)
- **Flight Test Program:** PM 60-72
- **Type Certificate Issued:** PM 84

## Special Conditions

### BWB Configuration
- Non-cylindrical pressure vessel design
- Distributed load paths (no traditional fuselage/wing separation)
- Access and inspectability of internal structure

### Composite Primary Structure
- Material qualification per CMH-17
- Damage tolerance philosophy (no crack propagation)
- Repair procedures and limitations

### LH₂ Tank Integration
- Cryogenic effects on adjacent structure
- Enhanced inspection requirements for cold zone
- Emergency procedures for cryogenic exposure

### SHM System
- System safety assessment per CS-25.1309
- Reliability and availability requirements
- False alarm rate limits
- Certification credit for SHM-enabled inspections

## Regulatory Correspondence
- Certification basis agreement with EASA/FAA
- Issue papers and resolutions
- Special condition proposals
- Exemption requests (if any)
- Certification meeting minutes

## Continued Airworthiness
- Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) per CS-25 Appendix H
- Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS)
- Structural inspection program
- Damage tolerance inspections
- SHM system maintenance requirements
