# E1 - ENVIRONMENT

**Framework**: OPT-IN AMEDEOPELLICCIA  
**Axis**: T-TECHNOLOGY  
**Domain**: E1-ENVIRONMENT  
**Aircraft Platform**: AMPEL360 BWB Hâ‚‚ Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA

## Overview

The E1-ENVIRONMENT domain encompasses all on-board systems related to environmental control, protection, and monitoring. This includes cabin atmosphere management, fire protection, ice protection, and environmental impact considerations such as noise pollution.

## Scope

Environmental systems ensure:
- **Cabin comfort and safety**: Air conditioning, pressurization, temperature control
- **Fire protection**: Detection, suppression, and prevention systems
- **Ice and rain protection**: Anti-icing and de-icing systems
- **Pneumatic systems**: Air distribution and control
- **Water and waste management**: Potable water and waste systems
- **Environmental impact**: Noise pollution monitoring and mitigation
