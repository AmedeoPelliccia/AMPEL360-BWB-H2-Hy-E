# 18-50: Hydrogen System Vibration

## Purpose
Analysis and monitoring of vibration in hydrogen fuel system components, addressing unique challenges of cryogenic LH₂ flow.

## Components
- **18-50-01:** Flow-Induced Vibration Analysis
- **18-50-02:** Cryogenic Piping Resonance
- **18-50-03:** LH₂ Pump Cavitation Monitoring
- **18-50-04:** Valve Actuation Vibration
- **18-50-05:** Two-Phase Flow Pulsation
- **18-50-06:** Acoustic Resonance Avoidance

## Key Standards
- ISO 19880-8 (Gaseous Hydrogen Fuel Quality)
- ASME B31.12 (Hydrogen Piping and Pipelines)
- SAE ARP6418 (Fuel Cell Safety for Aircraft)

## Unique Challenges
- Cryogenic temperatures (-253°C)
- Two-phase flow (boil-off)
- Pressure pulsations
- Thermal shock during startup

## Status
Active Development
