domain: T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS
subdomain: E1-ENVIRONMENT
cross_reference: E2-ENERGY (vibration monitoring and energy harvesting aspects)
aircraft_platform: AMPEL360 BWB H2 Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA

status: Active Development
provisional: true
provisional_justification: >
  ATA 18 is not part of standard ATA iSpec 2200 specification. 
  Established as provisional chapter for AMPEL360 program to centralize 
  vibration and noise analysis activities critical for certification, 
  safety, and operational performance of hydrogen-electric BWB aircraft.
  Moved to E1-ENVIRONMENT as primary location (noise/environmental focus) 
  with cross-reference to E2-ENERGY (vibration monitoring/energy harvesting).
