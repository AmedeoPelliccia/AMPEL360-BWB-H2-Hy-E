  ATA 51 is a standard ATA iSpec 2200 chapter covering general structural 
  practices and principles. For AMPEL360, this chapter establishes the 
  foundational structural design philosophy for the BWB composite airframe, 
  including damage tolerance, structural health monitoring (SHM), cryogenic 
  effects from LH₂ tank integration, and CAOS-integrated Digital Twin/Service 
  Twin for structural integrity management.
