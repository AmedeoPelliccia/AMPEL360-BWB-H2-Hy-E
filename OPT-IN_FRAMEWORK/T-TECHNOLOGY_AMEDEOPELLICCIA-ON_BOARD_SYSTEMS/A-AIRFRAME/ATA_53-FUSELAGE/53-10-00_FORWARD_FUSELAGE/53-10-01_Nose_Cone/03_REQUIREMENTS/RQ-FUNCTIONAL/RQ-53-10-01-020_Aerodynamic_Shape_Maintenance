# RQ-53-10-01-020: Aerodynamic Shape Maintenance

## Requirement Statement
The nose cone shall maintain its aerodynamic shape within ±5 mm of design contour under all operational loads.

## Rationale
Shape deviations increase drag and affect airflow to air data sensors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Maximum deflection < 5 mm at limit load
- Surface waviness < 3 mm per meter
- No visible surface defects

## Compliance Status
Analysis complete - max deflection 3.2 mm
