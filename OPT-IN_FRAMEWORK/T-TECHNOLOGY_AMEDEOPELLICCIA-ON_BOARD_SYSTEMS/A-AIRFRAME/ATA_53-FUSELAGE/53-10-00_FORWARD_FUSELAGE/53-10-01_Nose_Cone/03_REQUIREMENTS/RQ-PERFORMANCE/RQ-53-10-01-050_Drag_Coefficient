## Requirement Statement
The nose cone shall achieve drag coefficient CD < 0.025 in cruise configuration.

## Rationale
Low drag reduces fuel consumption and extends range.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CFD analysis confirms CD < 0.025
- Wind tunnel test validates analysis
- Surface quality Ra < 3.2 μm

## Compliance Status
CFD analysis complete - CD = 0.023
