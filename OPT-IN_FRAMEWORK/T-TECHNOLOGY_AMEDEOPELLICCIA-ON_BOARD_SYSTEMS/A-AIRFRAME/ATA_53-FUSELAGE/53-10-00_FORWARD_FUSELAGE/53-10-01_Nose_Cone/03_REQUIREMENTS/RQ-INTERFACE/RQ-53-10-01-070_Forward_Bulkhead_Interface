# RQ-53-10-01-070: Forward Bulkhead Interface

## Requirement Statement
The nose cone shall mate to forward pressure bulkhead (53-10-03) with sealed, bolted joint capable of transferring all design loads.

## Rationale
Critical pressure-tight interface requiring precise dimensional control.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bolt hole pattern matches bulkhead (±0.5 mm tolerance)
- Seal compression 20-30% of nominal thickness
- Leak rate < 0.05 CFM at 8.5 psi
- Load transfer verified by analysis

## Compliance Status
ICD released, design complete
