# RQ-53-10-01-003: Pressure Load 8.5 psi

## Requirement Statement
The nose cone structure shall withstand cabin pressure differential of 8.5 psi without failure or excessive deformation.

## Rationale
Maximum cabin differential pressure at 41,000 ft altitude (8.5 psi cabin vs. 2.2 psi ambient).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hoop stress < allowable stress
- Pressure proof test to 17 psi (2× operating)
- No leaks detected during leak test

## Compliance Status
Analysis complete - MS = +0.65

## Traceability
- Parent: CS-25.365
