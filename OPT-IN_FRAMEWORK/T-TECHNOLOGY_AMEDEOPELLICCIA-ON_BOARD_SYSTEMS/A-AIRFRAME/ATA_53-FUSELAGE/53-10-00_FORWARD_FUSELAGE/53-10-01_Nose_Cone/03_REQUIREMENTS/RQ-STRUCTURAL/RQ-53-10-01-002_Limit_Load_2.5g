# RQ-53-10-01-002: Limit Load 2.5g

## Requirement Statement
The nose cone structure shall withstand limit load factor of 2.5g without permanent deformation.

## Rationale
Per CS-25.303, limit load represents the maximum anticipated load in service. Structure must remain elastic (no permanent deformation) at this load level.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All stresses remain below material yield/proportional limit
- No permanent deformation after load removal
- Margin of safety ≥ 0.0

## Compliance Status
Analysis complete - MS = +0.82

## Traceability
- Parent: CS-25.303
- Related: RQ-53-10-01-001
