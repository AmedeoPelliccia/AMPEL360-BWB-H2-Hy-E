## Requirement Statement
The nose cone structure shall withstand the design fatigue spectrum for 60,000 flight cycles without fatigue failure.

## Rationale
Service life requirement based on 30-year operational life at 2,000 cycles per year.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fatigue test to 2× design life (120,000 cycles)
- No crack initiation detected
- Meets damage tolerance requirements

## Compliance Status
Test planned Q3 2026

## Traceability
- Parent: CS-25.571
