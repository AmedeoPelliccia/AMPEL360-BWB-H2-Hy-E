# RQ-53-10-01-183: Fleet Damage Learning

## Requirement Statement
CAOS shall aggregate damage data from all nose cone components across the fleet to identify common failure modes and risk areas.

## Rationale
Fleet-wide learning improves predictive models and identifies systemic issues early.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Anonymous data sharing across AMPEL360 fleet
- Pattern recognition algorithms identify trends
- Monthly fleet health reports generated
- Automatic alerts for emerging failure modes

## Compliance Status
Algorithm development in progress

## Traceability
