# RQ-53-10-01-182: Real-Time Stress Monitoring

## Requirement Statement
The nose cone shall provide real-time stress monitoring through strain gauges integrated with CAOS.

## Rationale
Enable continuous monitoring of actual stress levels during flight for fatigue life tracking and anomaly detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 12 strain gauge locations on critical load paths
- Sampling rate: 100 Hz continuous
- Data accuracy: ±5% of applied strain
- Real-time upload to CAOS Digital Twin

## Compliance Status
Sensor layout defined, installation planned

## Traceability
Parent: RQ-53-10-01-180 (Digital Twin)
