# Radome Protection - Nose Cone (53-10-01)

## Function
The radome provides RF-transparent housing for weather radar while protecting against environmental hazards.

## Design Features
- **Material:** CFRP with minimal metal content for RF transparency
- **Transmission:** > 95% at 9.3 GHz (weather radar frequency)
- **Erosion Protection:** Polyurethane coating on leading edge
- **Lightning Protection:** Embedded conductive strips (segmented to minimize RF interference)

## Environmental Protection
- **Rain Erosion:** Tested to 400 knots for 20 minutes
- **Hail Impact:** 25mm hail at 150 knots
- **UV Resistance:** 30-year exposure without degradation
- **Moisture:** Hermetically sealed to prevent water ingress

## Maintenance
- Visual inspection every preflight
- RF transmission test every C-Check
- Erosion boot replacement every 5 years or as needed
