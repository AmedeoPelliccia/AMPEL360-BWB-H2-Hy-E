# Lightning Protection Zone 1A - Nose Cone (53-10-01)

## Zone Classification
The nose cone is located in **Lightning Zone 1A** - the highest probability zone for direct lightning strike attachment per CS-25.581 and AC 20-136A.

## Design Requirements
- Peak current: 200 kA
- Action integral: 2 × 10⁶ A²s
- Specific energy: 250 kJ/Ω

## Protection Design
- **Conductive Diverter Strips:** Copper mesh embedded in composite
- **Bonding:** < 2.5 milliohm between all conductive parts
- **Current Path:** Direct path to ground via fuselage structure
- **Testing:** 200 kA direct strike test required

## Compliance
Design meets CS-25.581 Zone 1A requirements with planned test validation.
