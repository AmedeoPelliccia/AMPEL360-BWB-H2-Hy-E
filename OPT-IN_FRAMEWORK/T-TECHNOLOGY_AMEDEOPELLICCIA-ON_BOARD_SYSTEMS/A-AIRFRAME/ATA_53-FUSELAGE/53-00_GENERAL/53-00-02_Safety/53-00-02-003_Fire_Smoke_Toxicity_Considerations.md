## 1. Purpose

Define the **fire, smoke, and toxicity (FST) considerations** for the AMPEL360 BWB fuselage structure, establishing:

- Structural design principles to support fire safety objectives.  
- Material selection criteria for fire resistance and toxicity.  
- Integration with fire protection systems ([ATA 26](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/E1-ENVIRONMENT/ATA_26-FIRE_PROTECTION/)) and interior furnishings ([ATA 25](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/P-PASSENGER_SYSTEMS/ATA_25-EQUIPMENT_FURNISHINGS/)).  
- Compliance with regulatory FST requirements.

This document focuses on **structural aspects** of FST; system-level fire protection is covered in [ATA 26](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/E1-ENVIRONMENT/ATA_26-FIRE_PROTECTION/).

---

## 2. Regulatory Basis

FST requirements for fuselage structure are derived from:

- **[CS-25.853](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)**: Compartment interiors (materials flammability).  
- **[CS-25.855](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)**: Cargo and baggage compartment fire protection.  
- **[CS-25.856](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)**: Thermal/acoustic insulation materials.  
- **[CS-25.1309](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)**: Equipment, systems, and installations (fire hazard assessment).  
- **[FAR 25.853-856](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25)**: Federal equivalents to CS-25.  
- **[AC 25.853-1](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars)**: Flammability requirements for aircraft seat cushions.

Additionally:

- **[EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)**: Where AI/ML systems monitor FST sensors (transparency, safety requirements).

## 3. Structural Fire Resistance

### 3.1 Principles

The fuselage structure shall:

1. **Support fire containment**: Provide fire barriers between compartments where required (e.g., cargo bays, APU compartment).  
2. **Maintain structural integrity**: Prevent premature collapse or breach during fire exposure per defined scenarios.  
3. **Minimize fire propagation**: Use materials and coatings that resist ignition and flame spread.  
4. **Facilitate escape routes**: Ensure structural integrity of exit paths during post-crash fires.

### 3.2 Fire Barriers

Where structural elements form fire barriers (e.g., cargo compartment liners, APU firewall):

- Materials shall meet burn-through resistance per [CS-25.855](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes).  
- Seals and penetrations shall maintain fire barrier integrity.  
- Structural testing per [AC 20-135](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars) or equivalent for powerplant installation may be adapted for BWB configuration.

### 3.3 Post-Crash Fire Scenarios

In survivable crash scenarios ([CS-25.562](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)), the fuselage structure shall:

- Maintain **escape route integrity** for required evacuation time (typically 90 seconds plus margin).  
- Resist **fuel fire exposure** long enough to enable occupant escape.  
- Minimize **breach of cabin pressure shell** that could allow fire ingress or accelerate smoke spread.

---

## 4. Material Selection for Fire Safety

### 4.1 Structural Materials

Primary structural materials (e.g., aluminum alloys, composites) are selected considering:

- **Flammability classification**: Self-extinguishing, flame-resistant, or non-combustible per [CS-25.853](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) Appendix F.  
- **Heat release rate**: Lower is better; materials shall meet 65 kW-min/m² total heat release and 65 kW/m² peak heat release rate.  
- **Smoke generation**: Low smoke density (optical density < 200 per FAR 25 testing).  
- **Toxic gas emission**: Minimize CO, HCN, HCl, and other toxic combustion products.

### 4.2 Insulation and Liners

Thermal and acoustic insulation materials adjacent to or within the fuselage structure shall:

- Meet **[CS-25.856](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)** for fire penetration resistance (12-minute oil burner test or equivalent).  
- Not propagate fire or generate excessive smoke/toxic fumes.  
- Be moisture-resistant to prevent degradation and fungal growth that could impair fire performance.

### 4.3 Coatings and Sealants

Coatings, paints, and sealants applied to structural surfaces shall:

- Be compatible with substrate material (no galvanic corrosion, delamination, or chemical attack).  
- Meet flammability requirements for their location (cabin interior, cargo, technical compartments).  
- Not significantly degrade smoke or toxicity performance of the overall assembly.

## 5. Smoke Management

### 5.1 Structural Considerations

While smoke detection and removal are primarily [ATA 21 (ECS)](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/E1-ENVIRONMENT/ATA_21-AIR_CONDITIONING_PRESSURIZATION/) and [ATA 26 (Fire Protection)](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/E1-ENVIRONMENT/ATA_26-FIRE_PROTECTION/) functions, the fuselage structure influences smoke behavior:

- **Compartmentalization**: Structural bulkheads and partitions limit smoke spread.  
- **Sealing**: Doors, hatches, and penetrations shall minimize smoke leakage between zones.  
- **Duct routing**: Structural provisions for smoke evacuation ducts and emergency ventilation paths.

### 5.2 Material Smoke Performance

All structural interior materials shall meet:

- **Smoke density requirements** per [CS-25.853](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) Appendix F, Part V.  
- Testing per ASTM E662 or equivalent (specific optical density ≤ 200).

---

## 6. Toxicity Control

### 6.1 Regulatory Requirements

Toxicity of combustion products is assessed per:

- **[CS-25.853](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)** criteria for materials in passenger and crew compartments.  
- **[AC 25-17A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars)**: Transport airplane cabin interiors crashworthiness handbook (toxicity considerations).

### 6.2 Material Selection Strategy

To minimize toxic emissions:

- Prefer materials with low halogen content (to reduce HCl/HBr production).  
- Avoid materials that produce significant HCN (hydrogen cyanide) under combustion.  
- Use fire-retardant additives that do not increase toxic gas generation.  
- Validate material performance through standardized combustion toxicity testing (e.g., NES 713, ISO 19700).

---

## 7. Integration with Fire Protection Systems

### 7.1 Structural Support for Fire Systems

The fuselage structure provides mounting points and routing for:

- **Fire detection sensors**: Smoke detectors, heat sensors, flame detectors in cargo/APU areas.  
- **Fire suppression systems**: Extinguisher bottles, distribution lines, discharge nozzles.  
- **Fire-resistant materials**: Supporting brackets, clamps, and penetrations must also meet fire resistance requirements.

### 7.2 Interface with ATA 26

Coordination with [ATA 26 (Fire Protection)](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/E1-ENVIRONMENT/ATA_26-FIRE_PROTECTION/) ensures:

- Fire zones are properly defined and aligned with structural compartmentalization.  
- Fire barriers coincide with structural bulkheads where feasible.  
- Inspection access for fire system components is designed into structure.

---

## 8. Testing and Certification

### 8.1 Material Testing

All structural materials and assemblies require:

- **Flammability testing**: Bunsen burner test (vertical and 60° per [CS-25.853](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) Appendix F, Part I).  
- **Heat release testing**: Ohio State University (OSU) calorimeter or cone calorimeter.  
- **Smoke density testing**: NBS smoke chamber (ASTM E662).  
- **Fire penetration testing**: For insulation materials (12-minute oil burner test per [CS-25.856](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)).

### 8.2 Full-Scale Fire Testing

Depending on novel BWB configuration features:

- **Cargo compartment fire tests**: Demonstrate fire containment and suppression effectiveness.  
- **Fuselage burnthrough tests**: For post-crash fire scenarios if required by certification authorities.  
- **Evacuation demonstrations**: Structural integrity during simulated fire exposure (coordination with [ATA 25](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/P-PASSENGER_SYSTEMS/ATA_25-EQUIPMENT_FURNISHINGS/) for seats/exits).

Testing plans are detailed in [53-00-07_V_and_V](../53-00-07_V_AND_V/).

## 9. Maintenance and Aging Considerations

### 9.1 In-Service Inspections

FST-relevant inspections include:

- **Insulation integrity**: Check for moisture ingress, damage, displacement that could degrade fire performance.  
- **Coating condition**: Ensure fire-retardant coatings remain intact and effective.  
- **Sealant condition**: Fire barriers and smoke seals must remain effective over time.

### 9.2 Aging Effects

With aircraft age:

- Materials may degrade (UV exposure, thermal cycling, moisture).  
- Fire performance may change; periodic re-validation may be required.  
- Service bulletins or airworthiness directives may mandate material replacements.

Maintenance tasks are coordinated with [ATA 05 (Time Limits / Maintenance Checks)](../../../../../../O-ORGANIZATION/ATA_05-TIME_LIMITS_MAINTENANCE_CHECKS/) and MPD development.

## 10. Special Considerations for BWB Configuration

The BWB configuration introduces unique FST challenges:

### 10.1 Large Cabin Volume

- Greater potential for smoke accumulation.  
- Longer evacuation distances require more robust fire/smoke barriers.  
- Enhanced compartmentalization may be needed to limit smoke spread.

### 10.2 Non-Traditional Layouts

- Cabin zones may be less clearly separated than in conventional tube-and-wing.  
- Fire barrier placement must be carefully optimized (structural vs. weight vs. access).  
- Emergency exit distribution affects structural integrity requirements during fire.

### 10.3 Composite Primary Structure

If using composite materials extensively:

- Fire resistance of composites under load is critical (matrix decomposition, fiber exposure).  
- Potential for delamination or loss of load-bearing capacity at elevated temperatures.  
- Post-fire inspections may require specialized NDT to detect subsurface damage.
