# ASSETS/exports — Automated Diagram Exports

**Purpose**: This folder contains diagrams and visualizations automatically generated by CI/CD pipelines or external tools (CAD, FEA, data visualization tools).

---

## Contents

This folder is populated by automated processes:

- **CAD Snapshots**: Automatically generated views from PLM system when CAD models are updated
- **FEA Visualizations**: Stress plots, deformation plots, modal shapes exported from FEA tools
- **Data Visualizations**: Charts and graphs generated from analysis scripts (Python, MATLAB)
- **Build Artifacts**: Documentation build outputs that include auto-generated figures

---

## Example Files (to be generated)

| File Name | Description | Source | Update Frequency |
|:----------|:------------|:-------|:-----------------|
| `53-00-01-E001_OML_Isometric_View.png` | Auto-generated isometric view of OML | CAD Export Pipeline | On CAD update |
| `53-00-01-E002_Frame_FR400_Stress_Plot.png` | Von Mises stress contour for Frame FR-400 | FEA Post-Processor | On analysis run |
| `53-00-01-E003_Weight_Breakdown_Chart.png` | Weight distribution by zone | Python Script | Weekly |
| `53-00-01-E004_Load_Case_Summary.png` | Bar chart of critical load cases | MATLAB Script | On loads update |

---

## Automation

- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions or similar pipeline triggers exports when source data changes
- **Scheduled Updates**: Some exports (e.g., weight summaries) run on schedule (nightly, weekly)
- **Manual Trigger**: Engineers can manually trigger export scripts when needed

---

## Versioning

- Exports are timestamped and versioned (e.g., `53-00-01-E001_OML_Isometric_View_2025-11-22.png`)
- Latest version is symlinked to a non-versioned filename for easy reference in documentation

---

## Usage Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Reference exported diagrams in Markdown docs using relative paths
- **Reports**: Include auto-generated plots in analysis reports to ensure up-to-date data
- **Reviews**: Display latest exports during design reviews for real-time status

---

## Exclusions

Do **not** manually place files in this folder. All content should be generated by automated tools. Manual diagrams and illustrations belong in `ASSETS/diagrams/`.

---

## Clean-Up Policy

- Old exports (>90 days) are archived to reduce repository size
- Archived exports moved to long-term storage (e.g., PLM archive, cloud storage)

---

## Document Control

- Folder created: 2025-11-22
- Generated with the assistance of AI (GitHub Copilot), prompted by **Amedeo Pelliccia**.
- Repository: `AMPEL360-BWB-H2-Hy-E`
