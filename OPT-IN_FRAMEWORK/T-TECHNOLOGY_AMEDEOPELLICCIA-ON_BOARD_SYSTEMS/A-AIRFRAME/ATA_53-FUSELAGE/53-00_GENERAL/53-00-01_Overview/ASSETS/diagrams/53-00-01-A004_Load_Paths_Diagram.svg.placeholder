# Placeholder for 53-00-01-A004_Load_Paths_Diagram.svg

**Purpose**: Illustrate the primary load paths through the BWB fuselage structure.

**Content to be created**:
- Schematic showing how different loads flow through the structure:
  - Wing bending loads → Center wing box → Fuselage frames
  - Cabin pressurization → Skin/stringers → Frames → Bulkheads
  - Landing gear loads → Gear attachment fittings → Main frames → Keel beam
  - Floor loads → Floor beams → Frames → Keel beam
- Color-coded arrows indicating load directions and magnitudes
- Key structural elements labeled (keel beam, spars, frames, pressure bulkheads)

**Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

**Creation**: To be developed by technical illustrator following AMPEL360 documentation standards.

**Referenced in**: 
- `53-00-01-003_Primary_Load_Paths_and_Design_Drivers.md`

**Note**: This is a placeholder file. The actual diagram will be created during detailed design phase and will replace this placeholder.
