# Placeholder for 53-00-01-A003_Coordinate_System.svg

**Purpose**: Illustrate the fuselage coordinate system (Fuselage Station, Buttock Line, Water Line).

**Content to be created**:
- 3D isometric view of BWB fuselage showing coordinate axes
- FS (Fuselage Station) - longitudinal axis, datum at nose
- BL (Buttock Line) - lateral axis, datum at centerline
- WL (Water Line) - vertical axis, datum at keel beam
- Example coordinates of key features (e.g., FS 2500, BL 0, WL 1500 = cabin floor at mid-fuselage)
- Sign conventions (positive directions)

**Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

**Creation**: To be developed by technical illustrator following AMPEL360 documentation standards.

**Referenced in**:
