## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **primary load paths** through the AMPEL360 BWB fuselage structure and identifies the **key design drivers** that govern structural sizing and configuration. Understanding these load paths is essential for design engineers, stress analysts, and certification engineers working on ATA 53.

---

## 2. Load Categories

The fuselage structure must withstand a wide range of loads throughout the aircraft lifecycle:

### 2.1 Flight Loads

- **Aerodynamic Pressure**: Distributed air loads on the outer mold line (OML) during flight
- **Maneuver Loads**: Accelerations from pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers (e.g., 2.5g pull-up, emergency turns)
- **Gust Loads**: Sudden vertical and lateral gusts per [CS-25.341](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)
- **Inertia Loads**: Mass of structure, systems, passengers, cargo, and fuel reacting to accelerations

### 2.2 Pressurization Loads

- **Cabin Differential Pressure**: Typically 8-9 psi (55-62 kPa) differential between cabin and ambient at cruise altitude
- **Pressure Cycling**: Repeated pressurization/depressurization cycles (fatigue consideration)
- **Emergency Depressurization**: Structural integrity must be maintained during rapid decompression

### 2.3 Ground Loads

- **Landing Loads**: Vertical and side loads from main and nose landing gear during touchdown
  - Limit load: Maximum expected in normal operations
  - Ultimate load: 1.5 × limit load (structure must not fail)
- **Taxiing and Towing Loads**: Loads from ground maneuvering, towing, and pushback
- **Jacking and Maintenance Loads**: Loads when aircraft is on jacks for maintenance

### 2.4 Emergency Loads

- **Crash Loads**: Dynamic loads during emergency landing ([CS-25.561](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes))
  - Forward: 9g, Upward: 3g, Downward: 6g, Sideward: 3g
- **Ditching Loads**: Water impact loads if applicable
- **Bird Strike / Foreign Object Impact**: Localized impact damage tolerance

### 2.5 Thermal Loads

- **Aerodynamic Heating**: Surface temperature rise at high-speed cruise
- **Cryogenic Tank Integration**: Temperature gradients from liquid hydrogen storage (if applicable)
- **Solar Radiation**: Heating from direct sunlight during ground operations

## 3. Primary Load Paths

### 3.1 Wing Bending Loads (Center Wing Box Integration)

**Load Path**:
1. **Wing aerodynamic loads** (lift, drag, moment) generated by outer wing panels
2. **Wing spars** carry bending and shear loads inboard
3. **Center wing box** (Zone 400) spans the fuselage width, transferring wing bending moment
4. **Fuselage frames and floor beams** distribute loads into the center body structure
5. **Keel beam** reacts vertical shear and provides a continuous load path

**Design Drivers**:
- Wing bending moment is the dominant load case for center wing box sizing
- Requires heavy, stiff structure with large cross-sectional area
- BWB configuration: The center body *is* the wing carry-through structure (no separate wing box under the cabin)

### 3.2 Cabin Pressurization Loads

**Load Path**:
1. **Cabin pressure** acts on fuselage skins, frames, and bulkheads
2. **Longitudinal tension** in skin and stringers (hoop stress analogy, adapted to flatter BWB cross-section)
3. **Transverse compression** in frames (frames resist outward pressure)
4. **Pressure bulkheads** (forward and aft) react axial pressure forces

**Design Drivers**:
- Skin thickness and stringer spacing driven by hoop stress and buckling stability
- Frame spacing and cross-section driven by pressure load magnitude and buckling
- BWB flatter profile increases bending in frames compared to cylindrical fuselage
- Fatigue from pressure cycling (typically 30,000-60,000 cycles over aircraft life)

### 3.3 Landing Gear Loads

**Load Path**:
1. **Landing gear struts** transmit vertical, side, and braking/torque loads
2. **Gear attachment fittings** (trunnions, side braces) attach to main frames
3. **Main frames** (heavy-gauge frames at gear attachment points) distribute loads
4. **Keel beam and floor beams** carry vertical loads into fuselage structure
5. **Wing carry-through structure** (Zone 400) provides reaction for main gear loads

**Design Drivers**:
- Landing gear loads are ultimate-level design cases for local structure
- Requires local reinforcements, thicker skins, larger frames at attachment zones
- Main gear typically located in Zone 400 (center wing box) for optimal load distribution

### 3.4 Floor Loads (Passenger and Cargo)

**Load Path**:
1. **Cabin floor panels** support passengers, seats, cargo
2. **Seat rails and cargo rails** transfer loads to floor beams
3. **Floor beams** span laterally (BL-to-BL) between fuselage frames
4. **Frames** carry loads down to keel beam or wing lower surface
5. **Keel beam** distributes loads fore-and-aft

**Design Drivers**:
- Floor beam spacing and cross-section sized for maximum cabin occupancy and cargo density
- Emergency landing loads (9g forward) drive seat rail attachment strength
- Multi-deck configuration (if present) requires additional intermediate floor beams

### 3.5 Door and Window Cut-Outs

**Load Path**:
1. **Cut-outs** interrupt skin and stringer continuity
2. **Door frames and window frames** (reinforced structure) carry loads around apertures
3. **Doubler plates** or thicker skins redistribute stresses
4. **Adjacent frames** carry increased loads due to load redistribution

**Design Drivers**:
- Stress concentrations at corners of cut-outs require careful design and analysis
- Crack growth from cut-outs is critical for damage tolerance substantiation (see ATA 53-00-02 Safety)
- Door frames must react door seal loads (pressure differential) and door operation loads

## 4. Design Cases and Critical Conditions

### 4.1 Limit Load and Ultimate Load

Per [CS-25.301](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes):
- **Limit Load**: Maximum load expected in service (probability ≤ 10⁻⁵ per flight hour)
- **Ultimate Load**: Limit load × 1.5 (structure must withstand without failure)

**Critical Design Cases**:
- **Case 1**: Maneuver (2.5g positive, wing up-bending) + cabin pressure
- **Case 2**: Gust (50 ft/s vertical gust at cruise speed) + cabin pressure
- **Case 3**: Hard landing (limit sink rate, main gear first) + side load
- **Case 4**: Emergency landing (9g forward, 6g down, 3g side) — crashworthiness
- **Case 5**: Maximum cabin pressure differential at low altitude (rapid descent scenario)

### 4.2 Fatigue and Damage Tolerance

- **Design Service Goal (DSG)**: Typically 60,000 flights or 120,000 flight hours for commercial aircraft
- **Fatigue Analysis**: Pressurization cycles, wing bending cycles, landing loads
- **Damage Tolerance**: Structure must sustain specified damage (e.g., 2-inch crack) for inspection interval

**Critical Fatigue Locations**:
- Door and window cut-out corners
- Fuselage splice joints between modules
- Landing gear attachment fittings
- Highly loaded frame-to-skin joints

## 5. BWB-Specific Design Considerations

### 5.1 Non-Circular Pressure Shell

- **Challenge**: Flatter cross-section leads to higher bending stresses in frames under pressurization
- **Solution**: Heavier frames, more closely spaced frames, or internal pressure bulkheads/partitions

### 5.2 Wing-Body Load Interaction

- **Challenge**: Wing and fuselage are structurally inseparable; wing loads directly influence center body structure
- **Solution**: Integrated structural optimization (wing and fuselage designed together, not separately)

### 5.3 Distributed Landing Gear

- **Challenge**: BWB may require multiple main gear bogies distributed laterally across center body
- **Solution**: Load distribution via floor beams and cross-bracing between gear attachment points

### 5.4 Large Cargo/Passenger Volume

- **Advantage**: Deep center body allows for multi-deck configuration and/or large cargo holds
- **Challenge**: Floor beams must span wider lateral distances; increased floor structure weight

## 6. Materials and Structural Efficiency

The choice of materials impacts load-carrying efficiency:

- **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)**: High strength-to-weight ratio, excellent fatigue resistance, used for skins and stringers
- **Aluminum-Lithium Alloy**: Lower cost than CFRP, good damage tolerance, used for frames and heavily loaded fittings
- **Titanium**: High temperature capability, used for gear attachments and engine mounts
- **Hybrid Structures**: CFRP skins with metallic frames (reduces galvanic corrosion concerns)

See `53-00-01-004_Materials_and_Manufacturing_Overview.md` for details.

---

## 7. Analysis Methods

Load path substantiation uses a combination of:

- **Global Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**: Full-aircraft or fuselage-level models to capture overall load distribution
- **Local FEA**: Detailed models of critical regions (door frames, gear attachments, cut-outs) with refined mesh
- **Hand Calculations**: Classical beam theory, hoop stress, buckling analysis for preliminary design and checks
- **Static Testing**: Full-scale static test article to validate ultimate load capability
- **Fatigue Testing**: Component and full-scale fatigue tests to validate life predictions

See `53-00-06_Engineering/` for detailed analysis procedures.

---

## 8. Safety Factors and Margins

- **Factor of Safety (FoS)**: Ultimate load = 1.5 × limit load (regulatory requirement)
- **Margin of Safety (MS)**: MS = (Allowable Load / Applied Load) - 1.0
  - MS ≥ 0 → Structure is adequate
  - MS < 0 → Structure is overstressed (requires redesign or justification)
- **Knockdown Factors**: Applied to material allowables for environmental effects, manufacturing variability, aging
