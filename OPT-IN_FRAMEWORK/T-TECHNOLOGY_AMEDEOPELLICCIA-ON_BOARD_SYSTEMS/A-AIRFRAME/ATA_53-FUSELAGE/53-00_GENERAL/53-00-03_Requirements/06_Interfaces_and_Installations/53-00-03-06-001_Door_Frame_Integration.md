# 53-00-03-06-001: Door Frame Integration

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-06-001**

## Title
Door Frame Integration

## Category
06_Interfaces_and_Installations

## Description
The fuselage structure shall provide door frames with adequate strength, stiffness, and dimensional stability to support door operation under all flight and ground conditions.

## Rationale
Proper integration of interfaces is critical for safe operation, structural integrity, and system functionality. Interface requirements ensure compatibility and prevent adverse interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Door frame maintains structural integrity under combined flight loads and pressurization
2. Frame distortion <2mm under operational loads
3. Door seal compression uniform within ±0.5mm
4. Door operation forces within limits per CS-25.783
5. Emergency exit doors operable after emergency landing loads

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component and assembly testing
- **Analysis**: FEA and interface load analysis
- **Inspection**: Installation verification and quality control

## Traceability
