# 53-00-03-06-004: Cargo Floor Integration

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-06-004**

## Title
Cargo Floor Integration

## Category
06_Interfaces_and_Installations

## Description
The cargo floor shall integrate with fuselage structure to provide load paths for cargo loads, seat tracks, and emergency landing loads while maintaining structural efficiency.

## Rationale
Proper integration of interfaces is critical for safe operation, structural integrity, and system functionality. Interface requirements ensure compatibility and prevent adverse interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Floor strength adequate for 150 lb/ft² uniform load plus concentrated loads
2. Seat track attachments rated for 9.0g forward emergency landing loads
3. Floor deflection <10mm between support points under maximum cargo load
4. Damage tolerance for floor panel damage scenarios
5. Provisions for cargo restraint system integration

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component and assembly testing
- **Analysis**: FEA and interface load analysis
- **Inspection**: Installation verification and quality control

## Traceability
