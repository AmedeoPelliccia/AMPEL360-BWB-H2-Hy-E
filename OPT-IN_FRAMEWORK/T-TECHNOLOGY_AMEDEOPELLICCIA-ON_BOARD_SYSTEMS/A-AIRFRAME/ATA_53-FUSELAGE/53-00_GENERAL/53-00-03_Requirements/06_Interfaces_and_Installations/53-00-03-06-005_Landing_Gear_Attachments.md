# 53-00-03-06-005: Landing Gear Attachments

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-06-005**

## Title
Landing Gear Attachments

## Category
06_Interfaces_and_Installations

## Description
Landing gear attachment points shall provide adequate load paths into fuselage structure for all landing and ground loads, including normal, hard landing, and emergency landing scenarios.

## Rationale
Proper integration of interfaces is critical for safe operation, structural integrity, and system functionality. Interface requirements ensure compatibility and prevent adverse interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Attachment strength for limit load × 1.5 safety factor
2. Fuse pin design for controlled gear separation in emergency landing
3. Load distribution into multiple fuselage frames and bulkheads
4. Fatigue life >60,000 landings with positive margin
5. Corrosion protection for attachment fittings

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component and assembly testing
- **Analysis**: FEA and interface load analysis
- **Inspection**: Installation verification and quality control

## Traceability
