# 53-00-03-06-003: Systems Penetrations

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-06-003**

## Title
Systems Penetrations

## Category
06_Interfaces_and_Installations

## Description
All systems penetrations through fuselage pressure vessel (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, data) shall maintain pressure integrity, structural strength, and fire protection.

## Rationale
Proper integration of interfaces is critical for safe operation, structural integrity, and system functionality. Interface requirements ensure compatibility and prevent adverse interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Penetrations sealed for pressure containment (leakage <0.1 SCFM)
2. Structural reinforcement at penetrations per stress analysis
3. Fire seals installed per CS-25.869 where required
4. Bonding and grounding provisions for lightning protection
5. Access for inspection and maintenance

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component and assembly testing
- **Analysis**: FEA and interface load analysis
- **Inspection**: Installation verification and quality control

## Traceability
