# 53-00-03-06-002: Window Integration

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-06-002**

## Title
Window Integration

## Category
06_Interfaces_and_Installations

## Description
The fuselage shall provide window cutouts and supporting structure with adequate strength to maintain structural integrity and pressure containment with installed windows.

## Rationale
Proper integration of interfaces is critical for safe operation, structural integrity, and system functionality. Interface requirements ensure compatibility and prevent adverse interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Window frame strength adequate for cabin pressurization loads
2. No crack initiation from window corners under fatigue loading
3. Window installation prevents water ingress
4. Optical quality maintained (no distortion from structural deformation)
5. Window retention system rated for emergency decompression loads

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component and assembly testing
- **Analysis**: FEA and interface load analysis
- **Inspection**: Installation verification and quality control

## Traceability
