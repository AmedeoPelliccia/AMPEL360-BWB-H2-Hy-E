# 53-00-03-04-001: Emergency Landing Loads

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-04-001**

## Title
Emergency Landing Loads

## Category
04_Crashworthiness

## Description
The fuselage structure shall withstand emergency landing loads as specified in CS-25.561 and CS-25.562, protecting occupants during survivable crash scenarios. The structure shall maintain occupant survival space and prevent hazardous deformation.

## Rationale
Emergency landing conditions represent critical safety scenarios where the structure must protect occupants even at the expense of structural damage. Proper design ensures maximum survivability in emergency landings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structure sustains static ultimate loads per CS-25.561(b) without collapse:
   - Upward: 3.0g, Downward: 6.0g, Forward: 9.0g, Sideward: 3.0g (each load factor applied separately)
2. Dynamic testing per CS-25.562 demonstrates occupant loads <16g spinal, <12g lateral
3. Seat attachment points maintain integrity under emergency loads
4. No intrusion into occupant space >6 inches for critical areas
5. Fuel system integrity maintained to prevent post-crash fire
6. Floor structure provides load path for occupant restraint systems

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Static testing and dynamic sled tests with anthropomorphic dummies
- **Analysis**: FEA of crash scenarios, occupant injury analysis
- **Inspection**: Post-test inspection of structural integrity

## Traceability
