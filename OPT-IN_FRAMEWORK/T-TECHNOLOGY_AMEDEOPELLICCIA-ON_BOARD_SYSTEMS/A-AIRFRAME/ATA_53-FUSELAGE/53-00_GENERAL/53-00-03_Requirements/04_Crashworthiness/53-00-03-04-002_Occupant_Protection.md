# 53-00-03-04-002: Occupant Protection

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-04-002**

## Title
Occupant Protection

## Category
04_Crashworthiness

## Description
The fuselage structure and cabin interior shall provide adequate protection for occupants during emergency landing scenarios, minimizing injury through proper load paths, energy absorption, and prevention of hazardous deformations or projections.

## Rationale
Occupant protection is the primary goal of crashworthiness design. The fuselage must work as an integrated system with seats, restraints, and interior to maximize occupant survival and minimize injuries.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Head Injury Criterion (HIC) <1000 for all occupant positions
2. Occupant loads remain below injury thresholds per CS-25.562(c)
3. No sharp edges or projections in occupant contact areas during crash
4. Overhead bins and stowage compartments secured to prevent loose objects
5. Emergency exits remain operable after emergency landing (no jamming)
6. Adequate survival space maintained (12-inch radius around occupant torso)
7. Floor deflection <2 inches relative to seat tracks under crash loads

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Crash test dummy instrumentation, sled testing
- **Analysis**: Occupant injury modeling, finite element human body models
- **Inspection**: Interior compatibility assessment

## Traceability

### Parent Requirements
