# 53-00-03-04-004: Post-Crash Egress

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-04-004**

## Title
Post-Crash Egress

## Category
04_Crashworthiness

## Description
The fuselage structure and emergency exit system shall maintain post-crash egress capability, ensuring that all required emergency exits remain operational and accessible after survivable crash scenarios. Fuselage deformation shall not prevent or significantly delay emergency evacuation.

## Rationale
Successful evacuation after crash landing is critical for occupant survival, particularly if post-crash fire occurs. Exit functionality must be preserved despite structural deformation from crash loads.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All Type A, I, II, and III emergency exits remain operable after crash loads
2. Exit door frames maintain tolerances for door opening (distortion <0.5 inch)
3. Escape slides deploy successfully after crash (no structural interference)
4. Aisle width maintained >20 inches throughout cabin after crash deformation
5. Emergency lighting remains functional after crash (backup power)
6. Floor-to-exit threshold height <24 inches to facilitate egress
7. Demonstration of evacuation capability within 90 seconds per CS-25.803

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Emergency exit functionality after crash test, evacuation demonstration
- **Analysis**: Door frame distortion analysis under crash loads
- **Inspection**: Exit accessibility assessment after crash test

## Traceability

### Parent Requirements
- CS-25.803 (Emergency Evacuation)
