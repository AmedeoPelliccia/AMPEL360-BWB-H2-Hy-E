# 53-00-03-04-003: Energy Absorption Structures

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-04-003**

## Title
Energy Absorption Structures

## Category
04_Crashworthiness

## Description
The fuselage shall incorporate energy-absorbing structures (sub-floor, landing gear, seats) designed to attenuate crash loads and reduce occupant accelerations during emergency landing. Energy absorption shall be optimized to maximize occupant protection while maintaining structural integrity.

## Rationale
Controlled energy absorption is essential to reduce peak accelerations experienced by occupants during crash. Properly designed energy absorbers can significantly improve survivability by increasing deceleration time and distance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Energy absorbers provide stroke length ≥6 inches before bottoming out
2. Load-stroke curve optimized for constant or near-constant deceleration
3. Energy absorption efficiency >70% (ratio of absorbed energy to peak load × stroke)
4. Sub-floor structure crushes progressively without local buckling instabilities
5. Landing gear attachment design allows controlled collapse/separation
6. Seat energy absorbers integrate with fuselage floor system
7. No hazardous debris or sharp edges created during crushing

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Component crush testing, sled tests, drop tests
- **Analysis**: Explicit FEA of crash dynamics
- **Inspection**: Crush pattern analysis and failure mode assessment

## Traceability
