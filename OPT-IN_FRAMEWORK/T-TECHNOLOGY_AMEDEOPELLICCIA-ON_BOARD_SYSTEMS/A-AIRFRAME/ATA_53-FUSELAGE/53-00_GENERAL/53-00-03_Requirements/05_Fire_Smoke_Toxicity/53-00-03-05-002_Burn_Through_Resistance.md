# 53-00-03-05-002: Burn Through Resistance

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-05-002**

## Title
Burn Through Resistance

## Category
05_Fire_Smoke_Toxicity

## Description
Fuselage skin and thermal/acoustic insulation materials shall provide adequate burn-through resistance to protect structure and occupants from external fires (post-crash fuel fires) for sufficient time to enable evacuation.

## Rationale
External post-crash fires represent a significant threat. Fuselage materials must resist burn-through to maintain cabin integrity and provide evacuation time before fire penetrates to cabin interior.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Burn-through resistance ≥4 minutes for combined skin and insulation system (per CS-25.856(b))
2. No flaming or glowing on cabin side of insulation during 4-minute exposure
3. Insulation blanket materials meet flame penetration resistance requirements
4. Post-burn structural integrity adequate for evacuation loads
5. Testing conducted with fire source representative of post-crash fuel fire (2000°F)
6. Configuration testing includes typical installation details (fasteners, joints)

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Burn-through testing per CS-25.856
- **Analysis**: Thermal analysis of fire exposure scenarios
- **Inspection**: Installation quality verification

## Traceability
