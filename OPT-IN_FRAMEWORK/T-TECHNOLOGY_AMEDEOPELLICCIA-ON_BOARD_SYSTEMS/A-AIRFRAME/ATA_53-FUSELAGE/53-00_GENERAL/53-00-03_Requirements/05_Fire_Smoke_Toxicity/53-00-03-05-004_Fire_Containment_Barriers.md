# 53-00-03-05-004: Fire Containment Barriers

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-05-004**

## Title
Fire Containment Barriers

## Category
05_Fire_Smoke_Toxicity

## Description
The fuselage shall incorporate fire containment barriers (firewalls, fire seals, penetration protection) to prevent or delay fire propagation between compartments, protecting occupants and critical systems.

## Rationale
Compartmentalization limits fire spread and provides time for detection, suppression, and evacuation. Fire barriers are critical for containing fires in cargo compartments, lavatories, and other high-risk areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cargo compartment liners meet flame penetration resistance per CS-25.855(a)
2. Firewalls between cargo and passenger compartments resist fire for ≥15 minutes
3. All system penetrations (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) through fire barriers include fire seals
4. Fire seal effectiveness demonstrated by testing (no flame, heat, or smoke penetration)
5. Floor panels over cargo bays meet fire resistance requirements
6. Lavatory barriers and waste container fire suppression integrated with fuselage design

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Fire barrier penetration testing, fire seal testing
- **Analysis**: Fire propagation analysis using computational models
- **Inspection**: Installation verification of fire barriers and seals

## Traceability
