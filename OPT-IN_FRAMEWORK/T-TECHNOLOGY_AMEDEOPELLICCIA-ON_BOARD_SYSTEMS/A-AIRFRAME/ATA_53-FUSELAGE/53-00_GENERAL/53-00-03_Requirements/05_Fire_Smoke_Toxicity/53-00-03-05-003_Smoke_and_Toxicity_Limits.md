# 53-00-03-05-003: Smoke and Toxicity Limits

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-05-003**

## Title
Smoke and Toxicity Limits

## Category
05_Fire_Smoke_Toxicity

## Description
Fuselage materials shall meet smoke emission and toxicity limits to minimize hazards to occupants during cabin fire scenarios. Smoke density and toxic gas generation shall be limited to support evacuation and survival.

## Rationale
Smoke and toxic gases are primary causes of fatalities in cabin fires. Materials must be selected to minimize smoke production and generation of toxic combustion products (CO, HCN, HCl, etc.).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Smoke density: maximum specific optical density ≤200 (flaming mode), ≤100 (non-flaming mode) per ASTM E662
2. Toxic gas generation limits:
   - Carbon monoxide (CO) index <150
   - Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentration <150 ppm
   - Hydrogen chloride (HCl) <500 ppm (if halogenated materials used)
3. Optical density at 4 minutes ≤100 for all cabin materials
4. Certification testing includes worst-case material combinations and layups
5. Composite materials evaluated for toxic decomposition products

## Verification Method
- **Test**: ASTM E662 (NBS smoke chamber), ASTM F814 (toxicity)
- **Analysis**: Smoke and toxicity modeling for cabin environment
- **Inspection**: Material selection audit

## Traceability

### Parent Requirements
