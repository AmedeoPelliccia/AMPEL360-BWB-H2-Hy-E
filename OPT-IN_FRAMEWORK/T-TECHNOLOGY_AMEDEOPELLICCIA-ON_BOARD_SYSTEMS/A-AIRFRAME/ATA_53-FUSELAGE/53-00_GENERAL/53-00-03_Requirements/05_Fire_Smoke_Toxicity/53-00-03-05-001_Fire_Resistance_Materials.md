# 53-00-03-05-001: Fire Resistance Materials

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-05-001**

## Title
Fire Resistance Materials

## Category
05_Fire_Smoke_Toxicity

## Description
All fuselage materials (primary structure, insulation, interior panels, decorative surfaces) shall meet fire resistance requirements per CS-25.853 and related paragraphs, demonstrating compliance through standardized flammability testing.

## Rationale
Fire resistance of materials is fundamental to cabin fire safety. Materials must resist ignition, limit flame spread, and minimize heat release to provide time for evacuation and fire suppression.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vertical Bunsen burner test: burn length ≤6 inches, self-extinguishing within 15 seconds (per FAR 25 Appendix F Part I)
2. 45-degree angle test: flame propagation rate <2.5 inches/minute
3. Heat release rate: total <65 kW-min/m², peak <65 kW/m² (Ohio State University calorimeter test)
4. Large-scale fire test for cabin materials demonstrates acceptable fire growth
5. All materials certified with test reports per CS-25.853(a)
6. Material qualification program ensures batch-to-batch consistency

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Flammability testing per FAR 25 Appendix F
- **Inspection**: Material certifications and test reports
- **Analysis**: Fire safety analysis for cabin interior configuration

## Traceability
