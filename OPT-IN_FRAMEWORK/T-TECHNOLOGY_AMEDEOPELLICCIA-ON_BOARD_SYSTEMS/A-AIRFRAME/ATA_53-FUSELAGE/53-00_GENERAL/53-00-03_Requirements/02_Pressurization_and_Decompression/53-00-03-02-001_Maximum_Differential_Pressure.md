# 53-00-03-02-001: Maximum Differential Pressure

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-02-001**

## Title
Maximum Differential Pressure

## Category
02_Pressurization_and_Decompression

## Description
The fuselage pressure vessel shall safely contain a maximum differential pressure of 9.3 psi (64.1 kPa) between cabin interior and exterior ambient pressure, with appropriate structural margins. This requirement covers normal operations at maximum certified altitude.

## Rationale
Maximum differential pressure represents the most demanding operational condition for the pressure vessel. The structure must safely contain this pressure to maintain cabin environment and occupant safety at cruise altitude.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structural analysis demonstrates positive margin of safety at 9.3 psi differential pressure
2. Pressure vessel tested to 1.33 × maximum differential pressure without failure (proof test)
3. Burst pressure ≥2.0 × maximum differential pressure
4. No detrimental deformation at maximum operating pressure
5. Pressure distribution uniform throughout cabin volume (±0.1 psi)

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Full-scale pressure vessel proof test and burst test
- **Analysis**: FEA of pressure loads on fuselage structure
- **Inspection**: Post-test inspection for permanent deformation

## Traceability
