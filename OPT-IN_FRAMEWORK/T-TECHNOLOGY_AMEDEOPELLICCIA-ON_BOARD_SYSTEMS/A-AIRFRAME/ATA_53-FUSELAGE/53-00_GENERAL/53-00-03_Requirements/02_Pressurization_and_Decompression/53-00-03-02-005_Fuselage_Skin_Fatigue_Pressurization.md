# 53-00-03-02-005: Fuselage Skin Fatigue (Pressurization)

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-02-005**

## Title
Fuselage Skin Fatigue (Pressurization)

## Category
02_Pressurization_and_Decompression

## Description
The fuselage skin and longitudinal/circumferential joints shall be designed to resist fatigue crack initiation and growth due to pressurization cycling. Skin thickness, material selection, and joint design shall provide adequate fatigue life and damage tolerance characteristics.

## Rationale
Fuselage skin is subjected to high cyclic stresses from pressurization cycles, making it susceptible to fatigue cracking. Historical accidents (e.g., Aloha Airlines Flight 243) demonstrate the critical importance of skin fatigue resistance and damage tolerance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Fatigue test demonstrates ≥2× design service goal without skin cracking at lap joints
2. Maximum hoop stress in skin ≤50% of material ultimate strength at max pressure
3. Crack growth rate analysis shows inspection intervals ≥1,500 flight cycles
4. Skin thickness provides multiple load paths to prevent catastrophic failure
5. Longitudinal lap joints incorporate fail-safe features (tear straps, doublers)
6. Riveted joint design minimizes stress concentration (optimized spacing, edge distance)

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Fatigue testing of fuselage panels and joints
- **Analysis**: Detailed stress analysis (FEA), crack growth analysis
- **Inspection**: Teardown inspection after fatigue testing

## Traceability
