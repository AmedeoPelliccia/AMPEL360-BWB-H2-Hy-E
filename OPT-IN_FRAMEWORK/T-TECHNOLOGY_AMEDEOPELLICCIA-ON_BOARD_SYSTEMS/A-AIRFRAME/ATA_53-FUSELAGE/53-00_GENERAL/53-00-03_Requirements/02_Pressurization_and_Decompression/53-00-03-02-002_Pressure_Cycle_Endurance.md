# 53-00-03-02-002: Pressure Cycle Endurance

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-02-002**

## Title
Pressure Cycle Endurance

## Category
02_Pressurization_and_Decompression

## Description
The fuselage pressure vessel shall withstand a minimum of 60,000 pressurization cycles over the aircraft design service life without development of structural damage that would compromise safety or require major repair. Fatigue life shall be demonstrated considering spectrum loading.

## Rationale
Repeated pressurization and depressurization cycles induce cyclic stresses in the fuselage structure, potentially leading to fatigue crack initiation and growth. The structure must be designed for adequate fatigue life with appropriate inspection intervals.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Full-scale fatigue test demonstrates ≥2× design service goal (120,000 cycles) without critical damage
2. Crack growth analysis shows slow crack growth rates allowing inspection before critical size
3. Fatigue-critical locations identified and inspection intervals established
4. Analysis accounts for pressure cycle variability (flight profile spectrum)
5. Residual strength remains above limit load capability throughout service life

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Full-scale fatigue test with pressure cycling
- **Analysis**: Fatigue crack growth analysis (Paris law)
- **Inspection**: Periodic inspection program definition

## Traceability
