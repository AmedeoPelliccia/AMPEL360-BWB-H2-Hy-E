# 53-00-03-07-004: Predictive Analytics Integration

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-07-004**

## Title
Predictive Analytics Integration

## Category
07_SHM_and_Monitoring

## Description
The SHM system shall integrate with predictive analytics and health management systems to enable condition-based maintenance and optimize inspection scheduling.

## Rationale
Effective SHM enables condition-based maintenance, reduces inspection burden, improves safety through continuous monitoring, and supports predictive maintenance strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time damage growth monitoring and prediction
2. Integration with aircraft health management system (AHMS)
3. Automatic alert generation for detected damage exceeding thresholds
4. Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for monitored components
5. Maintenance recommendation generation based on damage state
6. Data export capability for fleet health management systems
7. Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Laboratory testing, flight testing, POD studies
- **Analysis**: Algorithm validation, performance analysis
- **Demonstration**: System integration and operational validation

## Traceability
