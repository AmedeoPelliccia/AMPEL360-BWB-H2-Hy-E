# 53-00-03-01-001: Ultimate Load Capability

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-01-001**

## Title
Ultimate Load Capability

## Category
01_Structural_Integrity

## Description
The fuselage structure shall withstand ultimate loads (1.5 × limit loads) without failure for a duration of at least 3 seconds. This requirement ensures structural integrity under extreme loading conditions as mandated by CS-25.303 and FAR 25.303.

## Rationale
Ultimate load capability is a fundamental safety requirement to ensure that the aircraft structure can withstand loads beyond normal operational limits, providing a safety margin for unexpected conditions or load exceedances.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Static tests demonstrate that the fuselage structure sustains ultimate loads for ≥3 seconds without catastrophic failure
2. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) validates stress levels remain below material ultimate strength
3. Test reports document margin of safety ≥0% at all critical locations
4. Compliance demonstration includes worst-case loading scenarios (combined loads)

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Full-scale static testing or component testing
- **Analysis**: FEA with validated material properties
- **Inspection**: Post-test inspection for permanent deformation or damage

## Traceability

### Parent Requirements
