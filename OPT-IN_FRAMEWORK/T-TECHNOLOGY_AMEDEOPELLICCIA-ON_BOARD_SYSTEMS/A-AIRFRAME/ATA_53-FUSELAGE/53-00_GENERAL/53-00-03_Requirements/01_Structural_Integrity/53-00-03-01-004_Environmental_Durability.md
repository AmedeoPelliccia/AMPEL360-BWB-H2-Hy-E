# 53-00-03-01-004: Environmental Durability

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-01-004**

## Title
Environmental Durability

## Category
01_Structural_Integrity

## Description
The fuselage structure shall maintain its structural integrity and performance characteristics throughout the aircraft's design service life when exposed to operational environmental conditions including temperature extremes, humidity, UV radiation, precipitation, and chemical exposure.

## Rationale
Environmental factors can degrade structural materials and affect performance over time. The structure must be designed to resist environmental degradation and maintain adequate strength, stiffness, and damage tolerance throughout the service life.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. No loss of structural capability >5% over design service life due to environmental exposure
2. Composite materials demonstrate resistance to moisture absorption <1.5% by weight
3. Metallic components show corrosion protection effectiveness >95% over service life
4. UV exposure testing (per ASTM G154) shows <10% degradation in composite mechanical properties
5. Thermal cycling (-55°C to +85°C, per CS-25.307) causes no structural degradation
6. Salt spray resistance per ASTM B117 (1000 hours minimum)

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Environmental chamber testing, accelerated aging tests
- **Analysis**: Service life prediction modeling
- **Inspection**: Periodic in-service inspection program

## Traceability
