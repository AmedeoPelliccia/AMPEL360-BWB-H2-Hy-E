# 53-00-03-03-002: Crack Arrest Features

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-03-002**

## Title
Crack Arrest Features

## Category
03_Damage_Tolerance_and_Inspection

## Description
The fuselage structure shall incorporate crack arrest features (tear straps, doublers, structural discontinuities) to prevent catastrophic crack propagation and limit damage to acceptable sizes. These features shall be strategically located at high-risk areas identified by damage tolerance analysis.

## Rationale
Crack arrest features provide fail-safe capability by limiting crack propagation even if damage grows beyond detectable size. They are essential for meeting damage tolerance requirements and preventing catastrophic structural failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Crack arrest features installed at all longitudinal lap joints
2. Tear straps sized to carry limit load with full crack in adjacent skin
3. Frame and stringer spacing optimized to limit crack growth between structural members
4. Analysis demonstrates crack arrest at design features under limit load conditions
5. No crack propagation beyond one structural bay under residual strength scenarios
6. Crack arrest effectiveness validated by component testing

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Residual strength testing with pre-cracked panels
- **Analysis**: Fracture mechanics analysis of crack turning and arrest
- **Inspection**: Design review of crack arrest feature placement

## Traceability
