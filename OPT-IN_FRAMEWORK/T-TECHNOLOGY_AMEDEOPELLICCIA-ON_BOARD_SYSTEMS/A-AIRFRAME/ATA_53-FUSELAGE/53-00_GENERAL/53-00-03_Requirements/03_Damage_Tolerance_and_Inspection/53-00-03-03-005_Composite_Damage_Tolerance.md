# 53-00-03-03-005: Composite Damage Tolerance

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-03-005**

## Title
Composite Damage Tolerance

## Category
03_Damage_Tolerance_and_Inspection

## Description
Composite fuselage structures shall demonstrate damage tolerance for manufacturing defects, in-service damage (impact, environmental), and accidental damage scenarios. The structure shall maintain required residual strength with barely visible impact damage (BVID) and detectable damage.

## Rationale
Composite materials exhibit different damage modes than metals (delamination, matrix cracking, fiber breakage). Specific damage tolerance requirements and verification methods are needed to ensure safe operation of composite fuselage structures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structure sustains limit load with BVID (impact energy determined per AC 20-107B)
2. Residual strength ≥limit load with damage from 25 J (100 ft-lb) impact
3. Compression-after-impact (CAI) strength ≥60% of pristine strength for BVID
4. Delamination growth rate acceptable for inspection intervals
5. Environmental effects on damage tolerance quantified (hot-wet conditions)
6. Damage resistance demonstrated for typical operational threats (tool drops, hail, bird strike)
7. Repair schemes validated for common damage scenarios

## Verification Method
- **Test**: Impact testing, CAI testing, damage growth testing
- **Analysis**: Progressive damage analysis, virtual testing
- **Inspection**: Damage detection capability assessment (NDI, SHM)

## Traceability

### Parent Requirements
- CS-25.571 (Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation)

- Layup: quasi-isotropic or application-specific
- BVID criterion: damage not detectable by visual inspection per maintenance manual
- Hot-wet condition: 82°C (180°F) and saturated moisture content
