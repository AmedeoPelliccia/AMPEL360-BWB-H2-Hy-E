# 53-00-03-03-003: Inspectability Requirements

## Requirement ID
**53-00-03-03-003**

## Title
Inspectability Requirements

## Category
03_Damage_Tolerance_and_Inspection

## Description
The fuselage structure shall be designed to facilitate inspection of damage-critical areas using appropriate non-destructive inspection (NDI) methods. Design shall provide adequate access, visibility, and surface conditions for effective damage detection at established inspection intervals.

## Rationale
Effective inspection capability is fundamental to damage tolerance. Structure must be designed from the outset to enable detection of damage before it reaches critical size, ensuring continued safe operation throughout service life.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All damage-critical locations accessible for inspection without requiring major disassembly
2. Access panels sized and located to enable required NDI methods (visual, eddy current, ultrasonic)
3. Surface finish suitable for NDI (smoothness, coating compatibility)
4. Inspection procedures detect 90% probability of detection (POD) for critical damage sizes
5. Inspection intervals established based on damage growth analysis
6. Inspection zones clearly marked on structure and documented in maintenance manual
7. Special tooling requirements minimized; standard NDI equipment preferred

## Verification Method
- **Analysis**: POD analysis for inspection methods
- **Test**: NDI capability demonstrations on test articles
- **Inspection**: Design review for accessibility and inspectability

## Traceability
