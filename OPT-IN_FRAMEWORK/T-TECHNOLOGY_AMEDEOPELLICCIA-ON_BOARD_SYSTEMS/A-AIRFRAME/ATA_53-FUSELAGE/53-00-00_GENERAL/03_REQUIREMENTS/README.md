# Requirements - 53-00-00 GENERAL

## Overview
This directory contains general requirements applicable to the entire fuselage system. Most component-specific requirements are documented at the component level (e.g., 53-10-01 for Nose Cone).

## Requirement Organization
Requirements are organized into 8 categories:
- **RQ-STRUCTURAL** - Structural integrity, loads, materials
- **RQ-FUNCTIONAL** - Functional performance requirements
- **RQ-INTERFACE** - Interface requirements with other systems
- **RQ-SAFETY** - Safety and hazard mitigation requirements
- **RQ-PERFORMANCE** - Performance metrics and targets
- **RQ-OPERATIONAL** - Operational procedures and limits
- **RQ-MAINTENANCE** - Maintenance and inspection requirements
- **RQ-CAOS** - CAOS integration and monitoring requirements

## General vs. Component Requirements
- **General Requirements (this level):** System-level requirements applicable across multiple components
- **Component Requirements:** Specific requirements for individual components (e.g., 53-10-01_Nose_Cone)

## Traceability
All requirements trace to:
- CS-25 / FAR Part 25 certification requirements
- SAE AIR7898 (hydrogen aircraft)
- ISO 13985 (LH2 tanks)
- ATA iSpec 2200 Chapter 53
- CAOS system requirements

## Status
Most requirements are defined at component level. This general level is reserved for cross-cutting requirements that affect multiple fuselage subsystems.

For component-specific requirements, refer to:
- 53-10-01 through 53-10-04 (Forward Fuselage components)
- 53-20-01 through 53-20-08 (Center Fuselage BWB components)
- 53-30-01 through 53-30-05 (Aft Fuselage components)
- 53-40-01 through 53-40-06 (H2 Tank Integration components)
- 53-50-01 through 53-50-05 (BWB Blend Structure components)
- And remaining subsystems...
