# 53-00-00 GENERAL

## Overview

This section provides general information, safety analysis, and overarching requirements for the entire ATA 53 Fuselage system. It establishes the framework and standards applicable to all fuselage subsystems.

## Scope

The GENERAL section covers:
- Overall fuselage design philosophy
- System-level safety analysis (FMEA, FTA, hazard analysis)
- Common requirements applicable across all fuselage components
- Interface definitions with other ATA chapters
- Certification strategy and compliance documentation
- CAOS integration framework for structural health monitoring

## Reference Documents

- CS-25 / FAR Part 25: Transport Category Airplanes
- AMC 20-29: Composite Aircraft Structure
- ATA iSpec 2200 Chapter 53: Fuselage
- CMH-17: Composite Materials Handbook
- SAE AIR7898: Liquid Hydrogen Fueled Aircraft System Design Requirements

## Key Characteristics

- **Configuration:** Blended Wing Body (BWB) with 22.5m center body width
- **Primary Structure:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite
- **Cabin Pressure:** 8.5 psi differential (ultimate 17 psi)
- **Service Life:** 60,000 flight cycles (30 years design life)
- **Weight Target:** 18,000 kg total fuselage structure

## Integration

This GENERAL section provides the foundation for all component-level documentation in subsections 53-10 through 53-90.
