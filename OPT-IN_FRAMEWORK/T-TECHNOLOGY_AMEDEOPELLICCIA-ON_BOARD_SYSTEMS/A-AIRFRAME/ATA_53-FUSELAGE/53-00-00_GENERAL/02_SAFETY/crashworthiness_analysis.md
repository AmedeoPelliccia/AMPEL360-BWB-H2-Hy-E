# Crashworthiness Analysis - ATA 53 Fuselage

## Document Information
- **Document ID:** CRASH-53-00-00
- **Revision:** A
- **Date:** 2025-11-03

## Overview
Analysis of fuselage structural performance in emergency landing and crash scenarios to minimize occupant injury and maximize survivability.

## Regulatory Requirements
- **CS-25.561:** Emergency landing conditions
- **CS-25.562:** Emergency landing dynamic conditions
- **CS-25.785:** Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses
- **CS-25.807:** Emergency exits (accessibility post-crash)

## Crash Scenarios

### 1. Emergency Landing (Wheels-Up)

**Load Conditions:**
- Vertical: 6.0g downward
- Longitudinal: 9.0g forward
- Lateral: 3.0g sideways

**Fuselage Response:**
- **Keel Beam:** Primary energy absorption structure
- **Floor Beams:** Distribute loads to seat attachments
- **Cargo Bay:** Crushable structure for energy dissipation
- **Cabin Floor:** Maintains integrity for evacuation

**Performance Targets:**
- Maintain cabin volume (no intrusion into occupant space)
- Preserve emergency exit functionality
- Limit occupant acceleration to survivable levels (<20g for 0.05 sec)

### 2. Ditching (Water Landing)

**Special Considerations:**
- **Flotation:** BWB configuration provides inherent buoyancy
- **Ventral Exits:** Critical for underwater egress
- **Water Impact:** Distributed loads across wide belly
- **Structural Integrity:** Maintain watertightness for flotation time

**Design Features:**
- Water-tight pressure deck floor
- Emergency flotation aids (deployable)
- Rapid evacuation through ventral and side exits
- Life raft deployment from doors

### 3. Bird Strike (Windshield/Nose Cone)

**Impact Conditions:**
- 4 lb bird at 250 knots (CS-25.631)
- No penetration into pressure vessel
- Maintain structural integrity for continued safe flight

**Energy Absorption:**
- Nose cone designed for controlled crushing
- Energy dissipation through composite material deformation
- Pressure bulkhead provides backup containment

### 4. Post-Crash Fire

**Fire Resistance:**
- **Cabin Materials:** Meet flammability requirements (CS-25.853)
- **Structure:** Maintain integrity for evacuation time (90 seconds)
- **H2 System:** Automatic venting prevents tank rupture in fire

**Fire Barriers:**
- Composite fire walls between H2 tanks and cabin
- 15-minute fire resistance rating
- Smoke and toxic gas containment

## Energy Absorption Features

### Keel Beam Structure
- **Design:** Controlled crushing zones
- **Material:** Aluminum honeycomb energy absorbers
- **Capacity:** Absorb 50% of landing energy
- **Stroke:** 300mm compression travel

### Floor Structure
- **Design:** Sacrificial composite crush panels
- **Load Path:** Direct loads around passenger cabin
- **Seats:** 16g-capable seat mounts bonded to floor structure

### Landing Gear Bays
- **Design:** Reinforced structure for gear loads
- **Doors:** Jettison capability for gear-up landing
- **Clearance:** Sufficient for gear collapse without cabin intrusion

## Hydrogen Safety in Crash

### Tank Protection
- **Location:** Below cabin floor, isolated by fire barriers
- **Crashworthiness:** Tanks designed to withstand 20g impact
- **Support Cradles:** Yield before tank rupture
- **Emergency Venting:** Automatic activation in crash

### Fire Prevention
- **Leak Detection:** Immediate H2 sensor activation
- **Automatic Venting:** Pyrotechnic valves open within 1 second
- **Ignition Prevention:** No ignition sources near tank bays
- **Fire Suppression:** Halon system in tank bays

## Occupant Protection

### Seat Attachment
- **Strength:** 16g forward, 6g down, 3g lateral
- **Floor Attachment:** Bonded inserts (tested to ultimate load)
- **Cargo Restraint:** Prevents cargo intrusion into cabin

### Emergency Egress
- **Exit Availability:** Maintain 50% of exits post-crash
- **Slide Deployment:** Automatic deployment in ditching
- **Lighting:** Emergency lighting (10-minute battery backup)
- **Signage:** Photoluminescent exit markings

### Occupant Space
- **Head Strike:** Minimize hard points in occupant vicinity
- **Flailing:** Adequate clearance for dynamic response
- **Restraints:** 3-point harness for all seats

## Testing and Validation

### Component Tests
- Keel beam crush test (static and dynamic)
- Floor panel crush test (16g seat load)
- H2 tank impact test (20g acceleration)

### Full-Scale Tests
- Emergency landing test (drop test from 14 ft)
- Ditching test (water impact at 30 knots)
- Evacuation demonstration (90-second target)

### Analysis
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of crash scenarios
- Occupant simulation (ATB/Hybrid III dummies)
- Fire propagation modeling

## Crashworthiness Summary

| Scenario | Survivability | Design Features | Compliance |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Emergency landing | High | Keel beam, floor integrity | CS-25.561 |
| Ditching | High | BWB buoyancy, ventral exits | CS-25.801 |
| Bird strike | N/A (no crash) | Energy absorption | CS-25.631 |
| Post-crash fire | High | 90-sec evacuation, H2 vent | CS-25.853 |

## Recommendations
1. Conduct full-scale drop test to validate energy absorption
2. Perform ditching certification test (if required)
3. Validate H2 emergency venting system in crash scenarios
4. Test emergency exit accessibility post-crash
5. Conduct evacuation demonstration with 300 volunteers
