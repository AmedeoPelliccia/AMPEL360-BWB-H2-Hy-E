# Regulatory Requirements Summary

## Applicable Regulations

### Primary Certification Basis
- [EASA CS-25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27) - Certification Specifications for Large Aeroplanes
- FAA 14 CFR Part 25 - Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes

## Key Structural Requirements

### CS-25.301 - Loads
- Structure must withstand limit loads without detrimental permanent deformation
- Limit loads are maximum loads expected in service
- Combinations of loads must be considered

### CS-25.303 - Factor of Safety
- Ultimate load = 1.5 × Limit load
- Structure must support ultimate loads for 3 seconds without failure

### CS-25.305 - Strength and Deformation
- Deflections under load must not interfere with safe operation
- Deformations must not cause failure of other structure or systems

### CS-25.571 - Damage Tolerance and Fatigue
- Structure must demonstrate:
  - Safe life (sufficient fatigue life)
  - Fail-safe (alternate load paths)
  - Damage tolerance (detectable damage before critical)
- Inspection program required

### CS-25.603 - Materials
- Materials must conform to approved specifications
- Material strength properties must be established with statistical basis (A-basis or B-basis)
- Design values must account for environmental effects

### CS-25.605 - Fabrication Methods
- Methods must produce consistently sound structure
- Quality control and inspection procedures required

### CS-25.613 - Material Strength Properties
- Design values must be statistically-based
- A-basis (99%/95%) for single-load-path
- B-basis (90%/95%) for redundant structure

## Compliance Approach

### Analysis
- Finite element analysis for stress, buckling, fatigue
- Hand calculations for verification
- Conservative assumptions where uncertainty exists

### Testing
- Material characterization tests
- Component tests for validation
- Full-scale static and fatigue tests for ultimate verification

### Inspection
- In-service inspection program
- Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) where applicable
- Maintenance manual with inspection procedures

## Certification Deliverables

### Required Documentation
- Structural Design Report
- Stress Analysis Reports
- Fatigue and Damage Tolerance Evaluation
- Test Reports
- Certification Plans
- Compliance Matrix

### Authorities Interaction
- Type Certification Board (TCB) meetings
- Issue Papers for unique features
- Compliance demonstration

## Special Considerations for BWB

### Novel Configuration
- May require special conditions or equivalent level of safety findings
- Emphasis on demonstrating BWB-specific structural behavior
- Coordination with authorities early in design phase

### H₂ Propulsion Integration
- Structural provisions for hydrogen storage
- Crash load protection for tanks
- Fire and explosion protection
