# Panel Analysis Summary

## Overview
Summary of structural analysis for fuselage skin panels.

## Analysis Completed
| Panel Zone | Static Analysis | Buckling | Fatigue | Status |
|-------------|----------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Upper Forward | Complete | Complete | Complete | PASS |
| Upper Mid | Complete | Complete | Complete | PASS |
| Upper Aft | Complete | Complete | Complete | PASS |
| Lower Forward | Complete | Complete | Complete | PASS |
| Lower Mid | Complete | Complete | In Progress | - |
| Lower Aft | Complete | Complete | Planned | - |

## Critical Design Cases
- Upper panels: Compression buckling under positive maneuver
- Lower panels: Tension under positive maneuver, pressure loads
- Side panels: Combined shear and pressure

## Minimum Margins
- Strength: MS = 0.08 (Lower Mid panel, ultimate load)
- Buckling: MS = 0.12 (Upper Forward panel, limit load)
