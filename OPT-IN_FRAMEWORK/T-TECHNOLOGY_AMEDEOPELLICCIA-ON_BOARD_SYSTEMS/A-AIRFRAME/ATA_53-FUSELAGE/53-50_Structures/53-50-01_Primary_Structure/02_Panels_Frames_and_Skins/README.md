# 53-50-01-02 Panels, Frames and Skins

## Overview

This section covers the design, analysis, and specification of primary structure panels, frames, and skins for the AMPEL360 BWB fuselage. These components form the outer shell and internal framework that resist flight loads, pressure loads, and provide aerodynamic surfaces.

## Design Requirements

### Skin Panels
- Withstand aerodynamic pressure distribution
- Resist bending and shear loads
- Maintain aerodynamic surface tolerances
- Provide lightning strike protection
- Enable efficient manufacturing and assembly

### Frames
- Maintain fuselage cross-sectional shape
- Resist hoop tension from pressurization
- Distribute concentrated loads
- Provide attachment for systems and equipment
- Enable access for inspection and maintenance

### Stringers
- Stiffen skins against buckling
- Carry axial loads (bending and pressure)
- Efficient load path for distributed loads

### Pressure Bulkheads
- Contain cabin pressure at fuselage ends
- Efficient dome or hemispherical design
- Integration with floor structure and systems
