# Joint Analysis Summary

## Purpose
Summary of structural analysis for all pressure shell joints and splices.

## Joint Analysis Results

### Longitudinal Splices
- **Upper-to-Side**: 92% joint efficiency, 180,000 flight fatigue life
- **Side-to-Lower**: 88% joint efficiency, 165,000 flight fatigue life

### Circumferential Splices  
- **FS 15.0**: 88% joint efficiency, 175,000 flight fatigue life
- **FS 30.0**: 88% joint efficiency, 175,000 flight fatigue life

### Bulkhead Joints
- **Forward Bulkhead**: 95% joint efficiency, 200,000 cycle life
- **Aft Bulkhead**: 95% joint efficiency, 185,000 cycle life

All joints meet CS-25.571 damage tolerance requirements.
