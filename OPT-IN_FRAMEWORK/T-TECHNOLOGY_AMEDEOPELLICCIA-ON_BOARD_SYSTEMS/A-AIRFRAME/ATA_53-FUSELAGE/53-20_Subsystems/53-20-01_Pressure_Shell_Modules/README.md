# 53-20-01 Pressure Shell Modules

## Purpose

This subsystem defines the primary structural pressure shell modules for the **AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft**, including upper shell, lower shell, side modules, pressure bulkheads, and all splices/joints required for pressure containment and structural integrity.

## Scope

The pressure shell modules form the primary load-bearing and pressure-containing structure of the Blended Wing Body fuselage. This subsystem covers:

- Upper shell module architecture and design
- Lower shell module architecture and design  
- Side shell modules and transition regions
- Forward and aft pressure bulkheads
- All shell module joints, splices, and fastening systems

## Key Components

### Shell Modules
- **Upper Shell Module**: Primary top surface integrating with wing structure
- **Lower Shell Module**: Bottom surface including cargo bay and landing gear integration
- **Side Shell Modules**: Transition regions connecting upper and lower shells
- **Pressure Bulkheads**: Forward and aft sealing structures

### Structural Features
- **Composite Construction**: Advanced carbon fiber and aramid hybrid layups per [53-20-A-204](../ASSETS/specifications/53-20-A-204_Composite_Layup_Standards.md)
- **Joint Systems**: Longitudinal and circumferential splices designed for fatigue life per [CS-25.571](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)
- **Load Transfer**: Continuous load paths throughout BWB integration regions

## Requirements

All pressure shell modules must comply with:
- [CS-25.365](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) - Pressurized cabin loads
- [CS-25.571](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) - Damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation
- [CS-25.783](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) - Fuselage pressure boundary

## Interfaces

The pressure shell modules interface with:
- **ATA 53-20-02**: Door surround structures and reinforcements
- **ATA 53-20-03**: Cabin floor support attachment points
- **ATA 53-20-04**: Landing gear bay reinforcements
- **ATA 53-20-05**: Cabin liner attachment provisions
- **ATA 57**: Wing-body blend integration zones

## Safety Considerations

Critical safety aspects include:
- Pressure containment integrity throughout design service life
- Fail-safe design with multiple load paths
- Damage tolerance for in-service inspection intervals
- Lightning strike protection per [CS-25.581](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)
