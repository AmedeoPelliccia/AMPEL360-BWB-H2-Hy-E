# 53-20-A-305 Damage Tolerance Assessment

## Purpose

Documents damage tolerance compliance per [CS-25.571](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) for ATA 53-20 Subsystems.

## Damage Tolerance Philosophy

The AMPEL360 fuselage structure employs a **fail-safe** design philosophy with:
- Multiple load paths around critical areas
- Crack stoppers at frame and stringer terminations
- Slow crack growth materials (CFRP, toughened resins)
- Regular inspection program

## Assumed Damage Scenarios

### Undetectable Damage
- **Size**: Manufacturing defects up to 3.2mm (0.125 inch)
- **Life**: Must sustain full design service life without growth

### Detectable Damage
- **Size**: 12.7mm (0.5 inch) through-thickness crack or equivalent
- **Growth**: Slow growth to critical size with 2× inspection interval

### Discrete Source Damage
- **Impact**: 50 J impact energy (typical ground vehicle impact)
- **Requirement**: Residual strength must meet limit load

## Critical Locations

1. **Door Corners**: High stress concentration, crack stoppers required
2. **Wing-Fuselage Joint**: Multiple load paths, careful detail design
3. **Landing Gear Attach**: Redundant fittings, high inspection frequency
4. **Splice Joints**: Multiple fastener rows for fail-safe behavior

## Inspection Program

- **Visual**: Every 400 flight hours
- **Detailed Visual**: Every 2,000 flight hours
- **NDT (Ultrasonic)**: Every 8,000 flight hours
- **Special Inspection**: Post-incident as required
