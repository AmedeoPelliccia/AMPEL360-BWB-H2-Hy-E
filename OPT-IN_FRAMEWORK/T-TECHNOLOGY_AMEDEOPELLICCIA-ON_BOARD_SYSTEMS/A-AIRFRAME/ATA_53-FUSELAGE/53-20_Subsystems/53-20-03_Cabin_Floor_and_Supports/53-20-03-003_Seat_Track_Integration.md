# 53-20-03-003 Seat Track Integration

## Overview

Seat tracks are integrated into the floor beam system, providing flexible seat configuration capability while transferring emergency landing loads to the primary structure per CS-25.561.

## Design Requirements

This component must comply with relevant [CS-25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) regulations for structural integrity, damage tolerance, and safe operation.

## Structural Design

Detailed structural design specifications including materials, dimensions, load paths, and analytical methods are provided for this component as part of the integrated BWB H₂ Hy-E fuselage structure.

## Material Specifications

Materials selected per [Material Specifications](../ASSETS/specifications/53-20-A-201_Material_Specifications.md) with appropriate strength, stiffness, and environmental resistance properties.

## Manufacturing Approach

Manufacturing methods leverage advanced composite fabrication techniques including automated fiber placement (AFP), hand layup where required, and precision machining of metallic fittings.

## Analysis & Testing

Structural analysis via finite element methods (FEM) and physical testing validate design adequacy for all load cases including static strength, fatigue, and damage tolerance.

## Inspection & Maintenance

In-service inspection requirements follow manufacturer recommendations and regulatory compliance per [NDT Requirements](../ASSETS/specifications/53-20-A-205_NDT_Requirements.md).

## Interfaces

This component interfaces with adjacent fuselage structures and systems as documented in interface control drawings.
