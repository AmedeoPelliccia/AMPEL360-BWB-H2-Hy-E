# RQ-53-20-03-180: Distributed Strain Sensing

## Requirement Statement
The BWB outer skin panels shall be equipped with distributed fiber optic strain sensors for continuous structural health monitoring.

## Rationale
Enable real-time damage detection, fatigue tracking, and predictive maintenance through CAOS integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fiber optic sensors: 2 km total length
- Spatial resolution: 0.1m
- Strain accuracy: ±10 με
- Sampling rate: 10 Hz continuous
- Coverage: All critical panel areas and frame joints

## Compliance Status
Sensor layout designed, installation procedure in development

## Traceability
Parent: CAOS system requirements
