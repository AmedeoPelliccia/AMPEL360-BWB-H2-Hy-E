# RQ-53-20-03-183: Fatigue Life Prediction

## Requirement Statement
The CAOS system shall predict remaining fatigue life of BWB outer skin panels based on actual flight loads measured by distributed sensors.

## Rationale
Enable condition-based maintenance and optimize inspection intervals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fatigue damage index calculated for every sensor location
- Prediction accuracy: ±10% of test-validated model
- Remaining life estimate updated after each flight
- Alert generated when 90% of design life consumed

## Compliance Status
Algorithm in development, requires flight test validation

## Traceability
Parent: CS-25.571 (Fatigue Evaluation)
