# RQ-53-20-03-181: Damage Detection Algorithm

## Requirement Statement
The CAOS system shall detect and localize damage in BWB outer skin panels using machine learning algorithms applied to distributed sensor data.

## Rationale
Automated damage detection enables proactive maintenance and reduces inspection burden.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Delamination detection: > 50mm diameter
- Crack detection: > 25mm length
- Impact damage detection: > 100 Joules impact energy
- False alarm rate: < 5%
- Detection confidence: > 95%

## Compliance Status
Algorithm development in progress, validation planned

## Traceability
