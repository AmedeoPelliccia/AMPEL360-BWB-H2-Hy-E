# RQ-53-20-03-054: Surface Waviness < 3mm per meter

## Requirement Statement
The BWB outer skin panels shall have surface waviness < 3mm per meter of span for aerodynamic efficiency.

## Rationale
Excessive surface waviness increases skin friction drag.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Measured waviness < 3mm per meter (1m straightedge)
- Surface quality Ra < 3.2 μm
- Manufacturing process control established

## Compliance Status
Manufacturing tolerance specification released

## Traceability
