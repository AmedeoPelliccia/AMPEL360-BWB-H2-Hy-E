# RQ-53-20-03-100: Fail-Safe Design

## Requirement Statement
The BWB outer skin panels shall incorporate fail-safe features including multiple load paths and crack arrestors.

## Rationale
CS-25.571 requires fail-safe structure to prevent catastrophic failure from single crack.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Crack arrestor at every frame (500mm spacing)
- Stringers provide alternate load path
- Two-bay crack criterion demonstrated
- Residual strength ≥ limit load with damage

## Compliance Status
Design complete, substantiation in progress

## Traceability
Parent: CS-25.571(a)
