# RQ-53-20-03-020: Aerodynamic Surface Continuity

## Requirement Statement
The BWB outer skin panels shall maintain smooth aerodynamic surface with step/gap < 1mm at all panel joints.

## Rationale
Surface discontinuities increase drag and disturb boundary layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Step height < 1mm at all panel-to-panel joints
- Gap width < 1mm at all joints
- Surface waviness < 3mm per meter

## Compliance Status
Manufacturing tolerance specification released

## Traceability
