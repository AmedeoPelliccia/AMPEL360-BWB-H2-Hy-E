  │             └─ NO → Await orders
```

### 9.2 Slide Failure Decision

```
Door Open
  │
  ├─ Slide auto-deploy?
  │    ├─ YES → Verify both lanes
  │    │         ├─ Both OK → EVACUATE
  │    │         └─ One blocked → Use good lane
  │    └─ NO → Pull manual handle
  │             ├─ Deploys → EVACUATE
  │             └─ No deploy → Redirect to other exit
