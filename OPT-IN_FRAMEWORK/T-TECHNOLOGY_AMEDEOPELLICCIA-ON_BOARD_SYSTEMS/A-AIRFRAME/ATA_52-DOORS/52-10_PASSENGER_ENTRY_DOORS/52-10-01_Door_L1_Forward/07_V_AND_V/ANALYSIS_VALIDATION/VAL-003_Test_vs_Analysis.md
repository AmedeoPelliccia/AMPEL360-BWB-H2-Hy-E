## 1. OBJECTIVE

Comprehensive comparison of all analytical predictions (AI + FEA) against test results.

---

## 2. COMPARISON MATRIX

### 2.1 Structural Performance

| Parameter | AI Prediction | FEA Prediction | Test Result | Error (FEA) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Mass (kg) | 114 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Mode 1 (Hz) | 25 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Mode 1 damping (%) | 2.0 | N/A | TBD | N/A |
| Ultimate capability (psi) | 17+ | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Panel deflection @ 8.5psi (mm) | 15 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Peak strain @ latches (με) | 4500 | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### 2.2 Error Analysis

**Target Accuracy:**
- Mass: ±5%
- Frequency: ±10%
- Stress/Strain: ±20%
- Displacement: ±25%

## 3. DISCREPANCY INVESTIGATION

For any error >20%:
1. Review analysis assumptions
2. Check test measurement accuracy
3. Identify root cause
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update models accordingly

## 4. MODEL VALIDATION STATUS

**After Correlation:**
- [ ] FEA model validated for stress analysis
- [ ] FEA model validated for modal analysis
- [ ] AI predictions accuracy assessed
- [ ] Uncertainty bounds established
- [ ] Models released for production use
