## 1. SCOPE

Standard procedure for installing strain gauges on composite door panels for structural testing.

---

## 2. MATERIALS

### 2.1 Strain Gauges
- Vishay CEA-06-062UR-350 (rosettes)
- Vishay CEA-06-125UN-350 (uniaxial)
- Resistance: 350 Ω
- Gauge factor: 2.1 ±0.5%

### 2.2 Adhesives
- M-Bond 200 (cyanoacrylate)
- M-Bond Catalyst C
- M-Bond Neutralizer 5A

### 2.3 Protective Coatings
- M-Coat A (air-drying polyurethane)
- M-Coat J (two-part epoxy for harsh environments)

### 2.4 Solvents
- Acetone (surface cleaning)
- Isopropyl alcohol (final clean)
- MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) - if needed

### 2.5 Wire and Connectors
- 3-conductor shielded cable (22 AWG)
- Solder (60/40 tin-lead)
- Shrink tubing
- Terminal strips

---

## 3. SURFACE PREPARATION

### 3.1 Area Marking
1. Mark gauge center location per drawing
2. Mark gauge orientation (0° direction)
3. Allow 25mm × 25mm area for each gauge
4. Mark lead wire routing path

### 3.2 Surface Cleaning

**Step 1: Abrasion**
- Lightly sand with 320-grit silicon carbide paper
- Create slight texture (not smooth)
- Remove only paint/coating, not composite material
- Clean sanding debris with brush

**Step 2: Solvent Cleaning**
- Wipe with acetone-soaked gauze
- Scrub in circular motion
- Use clean gauze for each wipe
- Continue until gauze shows no contamination

**Step 3: Final Clean**
- Wipe with isopropyl alcohol
- Allow to air dry (2 minutes)
- Do not touch cleaned area

### 3.3 Surface Conditioning
- Apply M-Prep Conditioner A
- Scrub with cotton swab
- Wipe dry with gauze
- Apply M-Prep Neutralizer 5A
- Wipe dry
- Surface ready for 1 hour maximum

## 4. GAUGE INSTALLATION

### 4.1 Gauge Preparation
1. Remove gauge from package
2. Position on clean room tape (sticky side up)
3. Place tape on mounting surface
4. Apply catalyst to back of gauge (one coat)
5. Allow catalyst to dry (30 seconds)

### 4.2 Adhesive Application
1. Apply thin line of M-Bond 200 to gauge location
2. Position gauge on adhesive (via tape)
3. Press firmly with thumb (30 seconds)
4. Apply pressure over entire gauge area
5. Hold pressure for 1 minute minimum
6. Remove tape slowly at 180° angle

### 4.3 Cure
- Cure time at 25°C: 2 hours minimum
- Accelerated cure: 80°C for 30 minutes (if needed)
- Do not disturb during cure

## 5. WIRING

### 5.1 Lead Wire Attachment

**For 3-Wire Quarter Bridge:**
1. Tin gauge solder tabs with small amount of solder
2. Tin wire ends
3. Solder red wire to positive tab
4. Solder black wire to negative tab
5. Solder white/green wire to sense tab
6. Keep soldering time <2 seconds per joint
7. Inspect joints (smooth, no cold solder)

### 5.2 Strain Relief
1. Form service loop (10mm radius)
2. Secure with RTV adhesive
3. Route wire to avoid sharp bends
4. Label wire with gauge ID

---

## 6. PROTECTION

### 6.1 Coating Application
1. Apply M-Coat A with brush
2. Cover gauge and first 25mm of wire
3. Two coats minimum
4. Allow to dry between coats (1 hour)
5. Final thickness: 0.5mm minimum

### 6.2 Mechanical Protection
- For high-traffic areas: add aluminum foil shield
- For outdoor: use M-Coat J epoxy coating
- Label gauge location on surface

---

## 7. VERIFICATION

### 7.1 Electrical Check
- Measure resistance (should be 350 ±5 Ω)
- Check insulation resistance (>1000 MΩ)
- Verify wiring continuity
- Test for shorts to ground

### 7.2 Documentation
- Record gauge ID and location
- Photo of installation
- Resistance measurement
- Installation date and technician

---

## 8. QUALITY CONTROL

### 8.1 Acceptance Criteria
- ✓ Gauge properly aligned (±2°)
- ✓ No air bubbles under gauge
- ✓ Solder joints clean and shiny
- ✓ Coating complete and smooth
- ✓ Resistance within tolerance
- ✓ No shorts to structure

### 8.2 Rejection Criteria
- ✗ Misaligned gauge (>5°)
- ✗ Air bubbles under gauge
- ✗ Cold solder joints
- ✗ Damage to gauge grid
- ✗ Resistance out of tolerance
- ✗ Short to ground

## 9. TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Gauge won't stick | Contaminated surface | Re-clean, start over |
| Resistance wrong | Damaged gauge | Replace gauge |
| Noisy signal | Poor shielding | Replace cable |
| Drift | Temperature effect | Check gauge type |

---

## 10. SAFETY

- Acetone: Flammable, use in ventilated area
- M-Bond 200: Cyanoacrylate - bonds skin instantly
- Soldering: Hot iron, eye protection required
- MEK: Toxic, avoid prolonged exposure
