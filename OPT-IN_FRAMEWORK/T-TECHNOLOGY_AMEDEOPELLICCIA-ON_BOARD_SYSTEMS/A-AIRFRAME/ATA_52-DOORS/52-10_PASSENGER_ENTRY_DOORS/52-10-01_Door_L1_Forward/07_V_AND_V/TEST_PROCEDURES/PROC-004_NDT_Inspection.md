# Test Procedure - NDT Inspection

**Procedure:** PROC-004  
**Revision:** DRAFT  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

---

## 1. SCOPE

Non-destructive testing (NDT) procedures for composite door panel inspection.

---

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1 Ultrasonic C-Scan

**Purpose:** Detect delaminations, voids, and core damage

**Equipment:**
- Olympus OmniScan ultrasonic scanner
- 5 MHz immersion transducer
- Water bath or through-transmission setup
- Scanning resolution: 1mm grid

**Procedure:**
1. Set up scanner with door horizontal
2. Apply couplant (water or gel)
3. Scan entire panel area
4. Record amplitude and time-of-flight data
5. Generate C-scan image
6. Identify any indications
7. Measure and document anomalies

**Acceptance:**
- No delaminations >25mm diameter
- No voids >10mm diameter
- Skin-to-core bond >90% area

### 2.2 Tap Test (Coin Tap)

**Purpose:** Quick check for localized delaminations

**Procedure:**
1. Tap panel surface with coin or light hammer
2. Listen for change in sound (solid vs. hollow)
3. Mark suspicious areas
4. Confirm with ultrasonic inspection

**Acceptance:**
- Consistent solid sound across panel
- No dead spots or hollow sounds

### 2.3 Visual Inspection

**Purpose:** Surface damage, cracks, dents

**Equipment:**
- 10× magnifying glass
- Bright flashlight
- Inspection mirror
- Calipers (depth measurement)

**Procedure:**
1. Clean surface
2. Inspect under bright light
3. Check for:
   - Surface cracks
   - Impact damage
   - Delamination edges
   - Paint/coating damage
   - Fastener condition
4. Measure and document any findings

## 3. DOCUMENTATION

### 3.1 Inspection Report
- Date and inspector name
- Test article identification
- Method used
- Equipment calibration status
- Findings (with photos)
- Accept/reject status

### 3.2 C-Scan Archive
- Digital scan files (raw data)
- Processed images (C-scan)
- Analysis results
- Comparison with previous scans

---

## 4. FREQUENCY

- **Pre-test:** Mandatory baseline
- **Post-test:** Mandatory after all structural tests
- **Periodic:** Every 30,000 fatigue cycles
- **As needed:** After any suspected damage event

---

## 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Pass:
- No rejectable indications
- Consistent with baseline
- Within specification limits

### Fail:
- Delamination >25mm
- Through-thickness crack
- Core crushing
- Significant change from baseline
