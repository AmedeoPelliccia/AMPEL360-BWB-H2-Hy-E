# Risk Management Plan
## Door L1 Forward - ATA 52-10-01

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Risk Management Plan establishes the approach for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the Door L1 Forward system lifecycle.

### 2. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES

- Proactively identify potential risks
- Assess and prioritize risks systematically
- Develop effective mitigation strategies
- Monitor and control risk throughout lifecycle
- Communicate risk status to stakeholders

### 3. RISK CATEGORIES

#### Technical Risks
- Design risks (performance, integration)
- Engineering risks (analysis, validation)
- Manufacturing risks (processes, tooling)
- Technology risks (maturity, availability)

#### Program Risks
- Schedule risks (delays, dependencies)
- Cost risks (budget, resource allocation)
- Resource risks (personnel, equipment)
- Scope risks (creep, changes)

#### External Risks
- Regulatory risks (compliance, approval)
- Supplier risks (delivery, quality)
- Market risks (requirements changes)
- Environmental risks (conditions, regulations)

### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

#### Probability Scale (1-5)
1. Very Low (0-10%)
2. Low (10-30%)
3. Medium (30-50%)
4. High (50-70%)
5. Very High (70-100%)

#### Impact Scale (1-5)
1. Negligible - Minor inconvenience
2. Low - Some impact, workaround available
3. Medium - Significant impact, manageable
4. High - Major impact, difficult recovery
5. Critical - Severe impact, program at risk

#### Risk Score = Probability × Impact

**Risk Priority:**
- 1-4: Low (Monitor)
- 5-9: Medium (Manage)
- 10-14: High (Mitigate actively)
- 15-25: Critical (Immediate action)

### 5. RISK IDENTIFICATION

**Sources:**
- Design reviews
- Technical assessments
- Stakeholder input
- Lessons learned
- Expert judgment
- Historical data

**Frequency:**
- Continuous identification
- Formal review at milestones
- Weekly risk discussions
- Monthly risk assessment

### 6. RISK RESPONSE STRATEGIES

#### Avoid
- Eliminate the risk by changing approach
- Example: Use proven technology instead of novel

#### Mitigate
- Reduce probability or impact
- Example: Add design margin, conduct early testing

#### Transfer
- Shift risk to another party
- Example: Insurance, supplier guarantees

#### Accept
- Acknowledge and monitor
- Example: Low probability/impact risks

### 7. RISK MONITORING

**Key Activities:**
- Track risk status weekly
- Update risk register monthly
- Review mitigation effectiveness
- Identify new risks
- Close resolved risks
- Report to stakeholders

**Metrics:**
- Number of active risks by category
- Risk score trend
- Mitigation plan progress
- Closure rate
- New risks identified

### 8. RISK REPORTING

**Weekly:**
- Critical risks status
- New risks identified
- Mitigation actions progress

**Monthly:**
- Full risk register review
- Risk trend analysis
- Mitigation effectiveness

**Quarterly:**
- Executive risk summary
- Program risk assessment
- Strategic risk review

### 9. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

**Risk Manager:**
- Owns risk management process
- Maintains risk register
- Facilitates risk reviews
- Reports risk status

**Risk Owners:**
- Accountable for specific risks
- Develop mitigation plans
- Execute mitigation actions
- Report status

**Program Manager:**
- Approves risk responses
- Allocates resources
- Escalates critical risks
- Final decision authority

**Technical Leads:**
- Identify technical risks
- Assess technical impact
- Support mitigation development
- Provide subject matter expertise

### 10. RISK REGISTER MANAGEMENT

**Contents:**
- Risk ID and description
- Category and probability
- Impact and score
- Owner and status
- Mitigation plan
- Target closure date

**Updates:**
- New risks added immediately
- Status updated weekly
- Full review monthly
- Archive closed risks

### 11. ESCALATION PROCESS

**Level 1 (Score 1-4):** Risk Owner  
**Level 2 (Score 5-9):** Team Lead  
**Level 3 (Score 10-14):** Program Manager  
**Level 4 (Score 15-25):** Executive Management

**Trigger for Escalation:**
- Risk score increases
- Mitigation ineffective
- Impact realized
- Resource constraints

### 12. TOOLS AND SYSTEMS

- **Risk Register:** CSV-based tracking
- **Risk Dashboard:** Visual status
- **Analysis Tools:** Probability-impact matrix
- **Reporting:** Automated metrics
- **Integration:** Link to change management

### 13. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

**Review Triggers:**
- Major milestone completion
- Significant risk event
- Process inefficiency identified
- Annual assessment

**Improvement Sources:**
- Lessons learned
- Best practices
- Industry standards
- Stakeholder feedback
