# Engineering Change Notice: ECN-52-10-01-001
## Door Hinge Reinforcement

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Engineer:** Structures_Lead  
**Status:** Approved

### CHANGE DESCRIPTION
Add reinforcement doublers to upper and lower door hinge attachment points based on stress analysis results.

### REASON FOR CHANGE
Finite Element Analysis (conceptual phase) indicated potential stress concentration at hinge attachment points under ultimate load conditions. Reinforcement required to meet structural margin requirements.

### TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Affected Parts:**
- PN-52-10-01-001234: Door frame upper hinge fitting
- PN-52-10-01-001235: Door frame lower hinge fitting

**Changes:**
1. Add 2.5mm aluminum doubler to upper fitting
2. Add 2.5mm aluminum doubler to lower fitting
3. Increase fastener diameter from 6mm to 8mm
4. Add additional fastener row

**Materials:**
- Doubler: AL 2024-T3, AMS 4037
- Fasteners: Hi-Lok HL70-8-10, BACF7970
