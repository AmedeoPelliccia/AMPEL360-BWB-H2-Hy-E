# Change Request: CR-52-10-01-2025-001
## Update Seal Material Specification

**Date:** 2025-11-03  
**Requestor:** Design_Engineer  
**Classification:** B (Moderate Impact)

### DESCRIPTION
Update the door seal material specification to use advanced silicone compound with improved temperature resistance and durability.

### JUSTIFICATION
Current seal material has limited temperature range (-40°C to +70°C). New material extends range to (-55°C to +85°C) and improves service life from 5 to 8 years, reducing maintenance costs.

### IMPACT ANALYSIS

**Safety Impact:** Low
- No change to safety-critical functions
- Improved reliability in extreme conditions

**Cost Impact:** +$12,000
- Material cost increase: $8,000
- Testing cost: $4,000
- Total lifecycle savings: $35,000 (reduced maintenance)

**Schedule Impact:** 5 days
- Supplier qualification: 3 days
- Documentation update: 2 days

**Other Systems Affected:**
- Interface document (DOC-52-10-01-005)
- Maintenance manual (DOC-52-10-01-011)
- Spares catalog (DOC-52-10-01-012)

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
1. Update material specification to reference new compound (XYZ-2000)
2. Conduct compatibility testing with door structure
3. Update supplier qualification
4. Revise maintenance procedures
5. Update spares catalog

### ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED
1. **Keep existing material** - Rejected: Higher lifecycle cost
2. **Use EPDM compound** - Rejected: Inferior temperature performance
3. **Use fluorosilicone** - Rejected: Excessive cost increase

### APPROVALS

**Technical Review:**  
Approved by: Lead_Engineer  
Date: 2025-11-03  
Comments: Technically sound, good cost-benefit ratio

**Quality Review:**  
Approved by: QA_Manager  
Date: 2025-11-03  
Comments: Requires qualification test

**Program Review:**  
Approved by: Program_Manager  
Date: 2025-11-03  
Comments: Approved, proceed with implementation

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. Week 1: Supplier qualification testing
2. Week 2: Documentation updates
3. Week 2: Review and approval
4. Week 3: Release updated documents

### VERIFICATION
- [ ] Material qualification test completed
- [ ] Compatibility test passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Reviews completed
- [ ] Approvals obtained
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

**Status:** Approved  
**Assigned to:** Design_Engineer  
**Target completion:** 2025-11-10
