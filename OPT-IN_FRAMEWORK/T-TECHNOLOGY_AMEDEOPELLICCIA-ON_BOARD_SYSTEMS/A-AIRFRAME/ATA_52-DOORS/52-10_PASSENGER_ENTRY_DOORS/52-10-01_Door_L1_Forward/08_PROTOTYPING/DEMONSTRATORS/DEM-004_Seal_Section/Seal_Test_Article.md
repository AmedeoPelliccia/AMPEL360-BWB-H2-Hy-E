## DEM-004 Seal Section Development

**Document:** DEM-004-SEAL-TEST  
**Status:** Conceptual  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

### 1. OBJECTIVE

Validate door seal design and performance:
- Leak rate at operating pressure
- Compression characteristics
- Durability over door cycles
- Temperature effects
- Installation method

### 2. TEST ARTICLE SPECIFICATION

**Seal Type:** Bulb seal (inflatable type)  
**Material:** Silicone rubber  
**Section:** 500mm length (representative)  
**Mounting:** Same as production design

**Test Fixture:**
- Simulates door/frame interface
- Adjustable compression
- Pressure chamber capability
- Temperature control

### 3. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

| Parameter | Requirement | Test Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Leak rate | <0.1 CFM at 8.6 psi | Pressure decay |
| Compression force | 5-15 N/cm | Load cell |
| Permanent set | <25% after 1000 cycles | Dimensional |
| Temperature range | -40°C to +70°C | Environmental chamber |
| Durability | >120,000 cycles | Fatigue testing |

### 4. TEST PLAN

#### 4.1 Leak Rate Testing
- Pressurize chamber to 8.6 psi (normal cabin pressure)
- Measure leak rate over 30 minutes
- Acceptance: <0.1 CFM
- Test at room temp, hot, cold

#### 4.2 Compression Testing
- Measure seal force vs. compression
- Typical compression: 6-8mm
- Target force: 5-15 N/cm
- Verify spring-back after release

#### 4.3 Durability Cycling
- 1000 cycles (representative of Phase 1)
- Door closing/opening simulation
- Monitor seal condition
- Check leak rate after cycling

#### 4.4 Environmental Testing
- Cold: -40°C (ground storage)
- Hot: +70°C (on ground, sun exposure)
- Measure seal properties at extremes
- Verify no cracking or hardening

### 5. INSTRUMENTATION

- Pressure transducers (0-15 psi)
- Flow meters (leak detection)
- Load cells (compression force)
- Displacement sensors (LVDT)
- Environmental chamber

### 6. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Leak rate <0.1 CFM at 8.6 psi
- [ ] Compression force 5-15 N/cm
- [ ] No permanent set >25%
- [ ] Functions -40°C to +70°C
- [ ] Survives 1000 cycles

### 7. POTENTIAL ISSUES

**Issue:** Excessive leak rate
**Solution:** Increase compression, change seal profile

**Issue:** High closing force
**Solution:** Reduce seal section, change material

**Issue:** Permanent compression set
**Solution:** Different rubber compound, better spring-back

### 8. DELIVERABLES

1. Seal test report
2. Compression force data
3. Leak rate measurements
4. Durability test results
5. Design recommendations

### 9. COST & SCHEDULE

**Budget:** $10,000  
**Duration:** 6 weeks
