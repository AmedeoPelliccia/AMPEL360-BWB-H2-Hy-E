## ANTICIPATED ISSUES (Pre-Build)

### Issue 1: Hand Layup Variability
**Date Identified:** 2025-11-03  
**Phase:** Planning

**Description:**
Manual ply placement can lead to:
- Ply orientation errors (>±1°)
- Inconsistent overlap distances
- Wrinkles in corner radii
- Foreign object debris (FOD)

**Potential Impact:**
- Void content >5%
- Structural weakness
- Scrap parts ($50k+ each)

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Develop detailed layup procedures with photos
2. Use laser projection for ply placement (if available)
3. Train technicians extensively
4. Implement in-process inspections
5. Photo document each ply
6. Budget for 1 scrap part

**Prevention for Future:**
- Invest in AFP equipment
- Develop automated layup procedures
- Create video training materials
- Establish quality metrics

### Issue 2: Autoclave Availability
**Date Identified:** 2025-11-03  
**Phase:** Planning

**Description:**
Limited access to suitable autoclave:
- Size: Requires 2.5m × 1.5m minimum
- Schedule conflicts with other users
- Cost: $500/hour
- Location: May be off-site

**Potential Impact:**
- Schedule delays (weeks)
- Increased cost
- Coordination complexity

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Reserve autoclave time in advance
2. Identify backup facilities
3. Consider smaller test articles for process development
4. Optimize cure cycle to minimize time

**Prevention for Future:**
- Establish long-term autoclave agreement
- Consider investment in facility
- Develop out-of-autoclave (OOA) processes

### Issue 3: Tooling Lead Time
**Date Identified:** 2025-11-03  
**Phase:** Planning

**Description:**
Cure mold fabrication is critical path:
- 16-week lead time
- Single-source supplier
- High cost ($250k)
- Design changes expensive

**Potential Impact:**
- Program delay (4 months)
- Cost overrun if redesign needed
- Late start to manufacturing

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Complete FEA before mold order
2. Design review by multiple experts
3. Build in modification capability
4. Consider interim foam tools for early trials

**Prevention for Future:**
- Earlier tool design start
- Modular tool design
- Maintain tool supplier relationships
