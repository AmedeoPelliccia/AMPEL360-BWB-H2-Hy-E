# Foam Core Mockup Design
## SM-002 Full-Scale Fit Check Model

**Document:** SM-002-FOAM-MOCKUP  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

### 1. OBJECTIVE

Create full-scale non-structural mockup for:
- Interface verification with fuselage
- Mechanism fit checks
- Clearance verification
- Installation procedure development
- Ergonomics evaluation

### 2. MOCKUP SPECIFICATION

**Size:** Full scale (1120mm × 1880mm)  
**Material:** Foam core (blue or white foam)  
**Accuracy:** ±5mm (external envelope only)

**Construction Method:**
- CNC machined foam blocks
- Bonded together
- Surface finish: sanded smooth
- Painted for appearance

### 3. FEATURES TO INCLUDE

**Geometric:**
- Outer mold line (OML)
- Inner mold line (IML)
- Hinge locations
- Latch locations
- Handle position
- Window opening

**Functional (representative only):**
- Mounting brackets (non-load bearing)
- Mechanism envelope
- Clearances
- Access panels

**NOT INCLUDED:**
- Load-bearing structure
- Actual mechanisms
- Seals (pressure tight)
- Flight hardware

### 4. FIT CHECK PLAN

#### Interface Checks
- [ ] Fuselage frame attachment points
- [ ] Hinge pin alignment
- [ ] Latch keeper positions
- [ ] Electrical/pneumatic routing
- [ ] Interior trim clearances
- [ ] Slide raft interface

#### Clearance Verification
- [ ] Opening arc (no interference)
- [ ] Closed position (flush fit)
- [ ] Mechanism travel
- [ ] Maintenance access
- [ ] Emergency egress path

### 5. INSTALLATION TRIAL

Use mockup to develop:
1. Installation sequence
2. Tooling requirements
3. Access needs
4. Time estimate
5. Personnel count
6. Safety procedures

### 6. LESSONS TO CAPTURE

- Interface mismatches
- Tolerance issues
- Installation challenges
- Design improvements
- Procedure refinements

### 7. COST & SCHEDULE

**Budget:** $30,000  
- CNC machining: $15,000
- Materials: $5,000
- Assembly & finishing: $8,000
- Fit check activities: $2,000

**Duration:** 10 weeks  
**Priority:** Optional (recommended)
