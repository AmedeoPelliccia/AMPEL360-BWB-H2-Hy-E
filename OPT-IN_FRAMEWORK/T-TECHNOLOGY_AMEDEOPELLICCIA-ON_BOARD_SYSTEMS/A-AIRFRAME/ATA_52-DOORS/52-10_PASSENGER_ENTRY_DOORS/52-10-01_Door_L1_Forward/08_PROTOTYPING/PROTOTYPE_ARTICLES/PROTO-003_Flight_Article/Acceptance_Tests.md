## PROTO-003 Flight Article

**Document:** PROTO-003-ACCEPT-TESTS  
**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

### Ground Acceptance Tests

#### 1. Functional Tests
- [ ] Door opening/closing (powered and manual)
- [ ] Latch engagement (all 6 latches)
- [ ] Emergency release
- [ ] Warning system operation
- [ ] Slide deployment (armed mode)

#### 2. Leak Test
- [ ] Pressurize aircraft to 8.5 psi
- [ ] Measure leak rate at door seals
- [ ] Acceptance: <0.1 CFM

#### 3. Systems Integration
- [ ] Electrical system checkout
- [ ] Pneumatic system (if applicable)
- [ ] BITE (Built-In Test Equipment)
- [ ] Interface with aircraft systems

#### 4. Safety Checks
- [ ] Emergency egress path clear
- [ ] Placarding correct
- [ ] Emergency lighting functional
- [ ] Slide arming indicators

### Flight Test Objectives

#### Phase 1: Ground Tests
- Taxi tests with door instrumented
- High-speed taxi
- Abort scenarios

#### Phase 2: Initial Flight
- First flight (instrumented)
- Monitor structural response
- Vibration levels
- Acoustic environment

#### Phase 3: Envelope Expansion
- Various speeds and altitudes
- Pressurization cycles
- Emergency descent
- All-weather operation

### Data Collection

**Instrumentation Channels:**
- 20 accelerometers
- 30 strain gauges
- 10 pressure sensors
- 5 temperature sensors
- Door position/status

**Data Analysis:**
