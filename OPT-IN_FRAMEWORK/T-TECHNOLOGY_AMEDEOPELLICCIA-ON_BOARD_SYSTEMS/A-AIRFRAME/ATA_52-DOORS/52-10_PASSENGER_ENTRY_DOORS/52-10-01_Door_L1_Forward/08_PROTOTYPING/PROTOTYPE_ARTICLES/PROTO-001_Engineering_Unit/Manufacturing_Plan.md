# Manufacturing Plan
## PROTO-001 Engineering Development Unit

**Document:** PROTO-001-MFG-PLAN  
**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

### Manufacturing Sequence

1. **Preparation Phase** (Week 1)
   - Tool cleaning and release agent
   - Material thaw and kitting
   - Personnel briefing
   - Quality setup

2. **Layup Phase** (Week 2)
   - First face sheet (2 days)
   - Core bonding (1 day)
   - Second face sheet (2 days)

3. **Cure Phase** (Week 2-3)
   - Vacuum bagging
   - Autoclave cure (8 hours)
   - Cooldown and demolding

4. **Finishing Phase** (Week 3-4)
   - Trimming
   - Insert installation
   - NDT inspection
   - Final acceptance

### Critical Manufacturing Parameters

| Parameter | Target | Tolerance |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Ply orientation | Per layup | ±1° |
| Ply overlap | 6mm | 3-9mm |
| Debulk vacuum | 28 inHg | >26 inHg |
| Cure temp | 180°C | ±5°C |
| Cure pressure | 7 bar | ±0.5 bar |

### Quality Checkpoints

- [ ] Tool inspection before layup
- [ ] Photo each ply
- [ ] Debulk inspection
- [ ] Bagging leak check (<10 mbar/min)
- [ ] Cure cycle chart review
- [ ] C-scan after cure
- [ ] Dimensional inspection
- [ ] Final weight check
