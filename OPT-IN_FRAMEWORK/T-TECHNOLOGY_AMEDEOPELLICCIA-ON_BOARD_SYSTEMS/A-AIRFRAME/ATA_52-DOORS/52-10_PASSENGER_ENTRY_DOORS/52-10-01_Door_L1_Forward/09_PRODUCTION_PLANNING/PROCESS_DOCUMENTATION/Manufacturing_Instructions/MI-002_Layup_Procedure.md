## 11. TROUBLESHOOTING

| Issue | Cause | Correction |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Wrinkles forming | Inadequate consolidation | More pressure, slower application |
| Bridging over core | Core not debulked | Add debulk cycle |
| Ply won't stick | Tool too cold | Warm tool to 23°C |
| Adhesive curling | Too warm | Cool material, work faster |
| ECF no continuity | Broken strip | Replace ECF, re-lay ply |
| Bag leaking | Poor seal | Reseal with fresh tape |
