## 6. RISKS AND MITIGATION

### Risk: No Suitable DER Available

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** High (schedule delay)

**Mitigation:**
1. Start search early (2026 Q1)
2. Consider DER from outside Europe if needed
3. Consider FAA DER with bilateral agreement
4. Engage engineering consultancy with DER on staff

### Risk: DER Rejects FEA Methodology

**Likelihood:** Medium (due to current AI analysis)  
**Impact:** High (need to redo analysis)

**Mitigation:**
1. Engage DER before finalizing FEA approach
2. Use industry-standard FEA software
3. Follow AMC 20-29 for composite analysis
4. Provide mesh convergence studies
5. Validate with test data

### Risk: DER Unavailable for Critical Tests

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (test delay)

**Mitigation:**
1. Schedule witness events well in advance
2. Provide flexible test dates
3. Contract allows for backup witness (associate DER)
4. Video recording as supplementary evidence

### Risk: DER Cost Overrun

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (budget impact)

**Mitigation:**
1. Fixed-price contract for defined deliverables
2. Not-to-exceed budget clause
3. Regular cost tracking and forecasting
4. Contingency budget allocated
