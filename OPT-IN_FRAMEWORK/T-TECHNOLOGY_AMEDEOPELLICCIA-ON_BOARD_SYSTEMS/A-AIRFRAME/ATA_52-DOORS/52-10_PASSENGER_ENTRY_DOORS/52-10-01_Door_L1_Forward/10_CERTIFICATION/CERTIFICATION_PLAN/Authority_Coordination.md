## 5. ISSUE PAPERS

### Purpose
Issue papers are submitted to EASA early to discuss novel or non-standard compliance approaches. They allow EASA to provide guidance before significant work is completed.

### Planned Issue Papers

#### IP-01: Resonance with Propulsion System
**Issue:** Door Mode 1 (~25-30 Hz) may resonate with engine frequency (25 Hz)

**Proposed Resolution:**
- GVT to measure actual modal frequencies and damping
- Demonstrate damping ζ ≥ 3% per industry practice
- Flutter analysis per CS25.629
- Damping enhancement if needed (tuned mass dampers, viscoelastic layers)

**Submittal:** Pre-application meeting (2026 Q3)  
**Status:** Draft prepared

#### IP-02: Composite Damage Tolerance
**Issue:** Composite door skin damage tolerance goes beyond current AMC guidance

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Follow AMC 20-29 for composite structures
- Conservative residual strength analysis (50mm damage)
- Test validation at ultimate load
- Enhanced inspection program (short intervals initially)
- Building-block approach with coupon/element/subcomponent tests

**Submittal:** Pre-application meeting (2026 Q3)  
**Status:** Draft prepared

#### IP-03: Emergency Egress from BWB
**Issue:** Novel BWB configuration affects passenger flow and egress

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Demonstrate compliance with CS25.807, 25.809, 25.810
- Type A exit sizing maintained (42" x 72")
- Full-scale evacuation demonstration (90 seconds, 50% exits)
- Flight attendant training program
- Emergency lighting and marking per CS25.812

**Submittal:** Pre-application meeting (2026 Q3)  
**Status:** Draft prepared

#### IP-04: Lightning Strike Protection
**Issue:** Composite structure requires enhanced lightning protection

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Follow AMC 20-136A for lightning protection
- Zone 1A classification (door is external, likely strike point)
- Direct effects testing per SAE ARP 5414
- Conductive layer or expanded metal mesh
- Indirect effects analysis (EMI/EMP)

**Submittal:** Pre-application meeting (2026 Q3)  
**Status:** Draft prepared

---

## 6. SPECIAL CONDITIONS (Anticipated)

### SC-01: BWB Configuration
**Rationale:** Novel door installation in BWB fuselage not addressed in CS-25

**Expected Requirements:**
- Enhanced load analysis considering BWB stress distribution
- Validation of attachment to curved composite shell
- Proof that plug door mechanism functions in BWB geometry
- Demonstration of fail-safe design

**Impact:** Additional analysis and possibly additional testing

### SC-02: Composite Primary Structure
**Rationale:** Composite door as PSE requires enhanced damage tolerance

**Expected Requirements:**
- Building-block test program
- Enhanced inspection program
- Service experience reporting
- Possibly reduced inspection intervals initially

**Impact:** More extensive test program, ongoing service monitoring

### SC-03: H2 Proximity
**Rationale:** Hydrogen fuel system proximity requires enhanced fire protection

**Expected Requirements:**
- Enhanced fire resistance (beyond 15 minutes)
- Explosion protection considerations
- Vent system to prevent H2 accumulation
- Enhanced detection and warning systems

**Impact:** Enhanced materials, additional system integration

### SC-04: CAOS Integration (if safety-critical)
**Rationale:** Software control of safety-critical functions

**Expected Requirements:**
- Software certification per DO-178C
- Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
- System safety assessment per CS25.1309 / ARP 4761
- Qualification testing of software functions

**Impact:** Software development and certification costs
