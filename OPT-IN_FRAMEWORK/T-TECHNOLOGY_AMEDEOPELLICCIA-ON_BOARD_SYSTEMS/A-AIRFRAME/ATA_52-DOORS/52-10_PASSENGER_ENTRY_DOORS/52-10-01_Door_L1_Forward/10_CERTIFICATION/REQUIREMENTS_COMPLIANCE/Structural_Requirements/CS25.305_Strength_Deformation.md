# CS25.305 - Strength and Deformation

**Regulation:** CS25.305  
**Title:** Strength and deformation  
**Status:** Not Started - Test Required  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

## Regulation Text

**CS25.305 Strength and deformation**

(a) The structure must be able to support limit loads without detrimental permanent deformation. At any load up to limit loads, the deformation may not interfere with safe operation.

(b) The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without failure for at least 3 seconds, except that local failures or structural instabilities between limit and ultimate load are acceptable only if the structure can sustain the required ultimate load for at least 3 seconds. However, where structural flexibility is such that any rate of load application likely in service might produce transient stresses appreciably higher than those corresponding to static loads, the effects of this rate of application must be considered.

## Applicability to Door L1

Door L1 Forward is primary structure (PSE - Principal Structural Element) and must comply with CS25.305 for all applicable load cases, including:
- Pressurization loads (ultimate: 17.0 psi = 2.0 × relief pressure)
- Flight loads (maneuver, gust)
- Ground handling loads
- Emergency landing loads

## Compliance Approach

### Means of Compliance: **TEST** (Primary)

Static ultimate strength test is **mandatory** for door structure per CS25.305(b).

### Test Requirements

#### Ultimate Strength Test
**Load:** 17.0 psi ultimate pressure  
**Duration:** Minimum 3 seconds  
**Acceptance:** No failure, no instability  
**Instrumentation:** Strain gages at critical locations

#### Proof Test (CS25.307)
**Load:** 12.75 psi (1.5 × limit = 1.5 × 8.5 psi)  
**Duration:** Minimum 3 seconds  
**Acceptance:** No detrimental permanent deformation  
**Inspection:** Post-test dimensional check

## Supporting Analysis

### FEA Analysis (Required Before Test)
**Purpose:**
- Predict stress distribution
- Identify critical locations for instrumentation
- Calculate margins of safety
- Validate design before expensive test

**Current Status:** AI estimate only (NOT ACCEPTABLE)  
**Required:** Professional FEA (NASTRAN/ANSYS/ABAQUS)  
**Timeline:** 2026 Q1-Q2

### Predicted Results (AI - For Planning Only)
**⚠️ Not acceptable for certification**

- Max stress at ultimate (17.0 psi): 120-150 MPa (AI estimate)
- Allowable: 580 MPa (Al-Li 2099-T83 Ftu)
- Margin of Safety (MS): +0.12 to +0.25 (MARGINAL)
- Critical locations: Door frame attachment, window corners

**Action:** Replace with professional FEA before test

## Test Planning

### Test Article
- Full-scale Door L1 Forward assembly
- Representative interface structure (BWB shell section)
- All production materials and processes
- As-built configuration

### Test Fixtures
- Pressure chamber or bladder system
- Boundary conditions simulating BWB installation
- Load introduction representative of aircraft
- Safety containment if failure

### Instrumentation
**Strain gages:** 40-60 locations at critical areas
- Door frame (8 locations)
- Skin (16 locations)
- Window frames (12 locations)
- Attachment fittings (12 locations)
- Composite doublers (8 locations)

**Displacement:** LVDTs at key points
**Pressure:** Multiple pressure sensors
**Video:** High-speed cameras for failure capture

### Test Procedure
1. Pre-test inspection and dimensional check
2. Install instrumentation
3. Proof test: 12.75 psi for 3 seconds
4. Unload and inspect (no permanent deformation allowed)
5. Ultimate test: 17.0 psi for 3 seconds
6. Hold and monitor
7. Unload (if survives)
8. Post-test inspection

### Acceptance Criteria

**Proof Test (CS25.307):**
- ✅ Withstand 12.75 psi for ≥3 seconds
- ✅ No permanent deformation > allowable
- ✅ No visual damage
- ✅ Dimensional check within tolerance

**Ultimate Test (CS25.305):**
- ✅ Withstand 17.0 psi for ≥3 seconds
- ✅ No failure (separation, rupture, collapse)
- ✅ No structural instability
- ✅ Strain measurements validate analysis

### Test Witnessing
**DER witness:** MANDATORY for ultimate test  
**Authority witness:** Optional (typically DER sufficient)
