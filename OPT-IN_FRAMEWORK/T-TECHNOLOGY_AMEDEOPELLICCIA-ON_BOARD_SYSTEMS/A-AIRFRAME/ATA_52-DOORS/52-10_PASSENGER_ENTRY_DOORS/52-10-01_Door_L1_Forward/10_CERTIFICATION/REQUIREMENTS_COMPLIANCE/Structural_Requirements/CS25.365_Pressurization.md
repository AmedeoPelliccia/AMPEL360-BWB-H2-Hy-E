# CS25.365 - Pressurization Loads

**Regulation:** CS25.365  
**Title:** Pressurization loads  
**Status:** Conceptual - AI Estimate Only  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

## Regulation Text

The aeroplane structure, including doors, windows, and other openings, must be designed to withstand the flight and ground loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum relief valve setting.

## Requirement

**Maximum relief pressure:** 8.5 psi  
**Ultimate pressure:** 17.0 psi (2.0 × 8.5 psi per CS25.365)  
**Limit pressure:** Not applicable (relief valve limits)

## Applicability

Door L1 is part of pressurized structure and must withstand ultimate pressure of 17.0 psi without failure.

## Compliance Approach

**MOC:** Test + Analysis

### Test (Primary)
Static ultimate test at 17.0 psi (see CS25.305_Strength_Deformation.md)

### Analysis (Supporting)
FEA stress analysis to:
- Predict stress distribution
- Identify critical areas
- Calculate margins
- Support test instrumentation plan

## Current Status

**Analysis:** AI estimate only - NOT ACCEPTABLE  
**Test:** Not started  
**Action Required:** Professional FEA before testing
