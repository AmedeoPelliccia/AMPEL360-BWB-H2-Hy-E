# Special Conditions

**Document:** AMPEL360-52-10-01-SPECIAL-CONDITIONS  
**Status:** ANTICIPATED - NOT YET ISSUED  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

## Overview

Special conditions are regulatory requirements issued by the certification authority when the applicable airworthiness standards do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for novel or unusual design features.

For the AMPEL360 BWB Door L1 Forward, several special conditions are anticipated due to the novel configuration.

   - Pressure relief provisions
   - Ignition source elimination

3. **System integration**
   - H2 leak detection near door
   - Warning systems for flight crew
   - Emergency procedures for H2 leak
   - Maintenance procedures for H2 safety

### Status
- **Anticipated:** Yes (aircraft-level, may affect door)
- **Submitted:** No
- **Authority feedback:** Not yet engaged
- **Target resolution:** 2027 Q2

## SC-04: CAOS Software Integration (If Safety-Critical)

### Issue
If CAOS (Computer Aided Operations & Services) controls safety-critical door functions, software certification is required:
- Door control software
- Interlock logic
- Emergency operation override
- System monitoring and fault detection

### Anticipated Requirements
1. **Software certification**
   - DO-178C compliance (likely DAL B or C)
   - Software requirements traceability
   - Software verification and validation
   - Configuration management

2. **System safety assessment**
   - CS25.1309 compliance
   - ARP 4761 safety assessment
   - FMEA/FTA for door control system
   - Common cause analysis

3. **Testing requirements**
   - Software qualification testing
   - Integration testing with door hardware
   - Failure modes testing
   - Emergency operation validation

### Status
- **Anticipated:** Conditional (depends on final CAOS role)
- **Submitted:** No
- **Authority feedback:** Not yet engaged
- **Target resolution:** TBD based on design

## SC-05: Emergency Egress from BWB Configuration

### Issue
BWB passenger cabin configuration affects emergency egress:
- Non-traditional cabin layout
- Passenger flow patterns different
- Flight attendant visibility challenges
- Evacuation path considerations

### Anticipated Requirements
1. **Egress analysis**
   - Evacuation simulation for BWB layout
   - Passenger flow modeling
   - Egress time analysis
   - Bottleneck identification

2. **Testing requirements**
   - Full-scale evacuation demonstration
   - 90 seconds with 50% exits blocked
   - Representative passenger mix
   - Flight attendant procedures validation

3. **Operational requirements**
   - Enhanced flight attendant training
   - Evacuation procedure development
   - Passenger safety briefing updates
   - Emergency lighting placement

### Status
- **Anticipated:** Yes (aircraft-level, affects door design)
- **Submitted:** No
- **Authority feedback:** Not yet engaged
- **Target resolution:** 2027 Q3
