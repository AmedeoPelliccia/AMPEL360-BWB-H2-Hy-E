# Equivalent Safety Findings

**Document:** AMPEL360-52-10-01-EQUIV-SAFETY  
**Status:** PRELIMINARY - NONE REQUIRED YET  
**Date:** 2025-11-03

## Overview

Equivalent Safety Findings (ESF) or Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) findings may be required when literal compliance with a specific regulation is not possible, but an alternative means provides an equivalent level of safety.

At this preliminary stage, no equivalent safety findings are anticipated for Door L1 Forward. This document will be updated if circumstances change.

## Current Assessment: No ESF Required

Based on current design and certification approach:
- **CS-25 compliance is achievable** through standard means
- **No deviations from regulations** currently necessary
- **Special conditions may be required** (see Special_Conditions.md) but these add requirements rather than provide relief
- **All critical requirements** appear achievable by test, analysis, or demonstration

## Potential Future ESF Candidates

### If Design Changes Occur

#### ESF-01: Door Opening Force (If Applicable)
**Regulation:** CS25.783(c) - Door opening and closing forces

**Potential Issue:** 
If BWB door geometry results in opening forces outside normal range

**Equivalent Safety Approach:**
- Powered assist system
- Enhanced training for crew
- Warning system for excessive force
- Design validation by test

**Status:** Not needed with current design  
**Likelihood:** Low

#### ESF-02: Emergency Exit Dimensions (If Applicable)
**Regulation:** CS25.807 - Type A exit dimensions (42" × 72")

**Potential Issue:**
If BWB geometry constrains exit dimensions

**Equivalent Safety Approach:**
- Demonstrate equivalent egress capability
- Full-scale evacuation test
- Computational flow analysis
- Passenger clearance validation

**Status:** Not needed with current design (meets dimensions)  
**Likelihood:** Very Low

## ESF Process (If Required in Future)

### Step 1: Identification
- Identify regulation that cannot be met literally
- Document technical reason for non-compliance
- Assess safety impact
- Determine if ESF is appropriate (vs. special condition or exemption)

### Step 2: Technical Justification
- Analyze safety intent of regulation
- Propose alternative means
- Show equivalent or better safety level
- Provide supporting analysis and data

### Step 3: Authority Engagement
- Discuss with EASA early
- Submit formal ESF request
- Provide technical substantiation
- Respond to authority questions

### Step 4: Approval
- EASA issues ESF (if accepted)
- ESF becomes part of certification basis
- Compliance demonstrated per ESF
- Documentation in TCDS

## Monitoring

This document will be reviewed quarterly throughout the certification program. If any potential ESF needs are identified, they will be added to this document and communicated to stakeholders immediately.
