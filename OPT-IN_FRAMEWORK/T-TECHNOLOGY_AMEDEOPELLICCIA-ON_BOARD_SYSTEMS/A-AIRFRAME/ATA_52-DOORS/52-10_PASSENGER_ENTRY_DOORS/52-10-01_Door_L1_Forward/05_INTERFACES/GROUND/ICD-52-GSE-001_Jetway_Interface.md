## 2. DOOR INTERFACE DIMENSIONS

### 2.1 Door Sill Specifications
- Sill height (empty aircraft): 2,500mm above ground
- Sill height (loaded): 2,350mm above ground (±100mm)
- Sill width: 810mm clear opening
- Sill depth: 50mm door threshold

### 2.2 Fuselage Curvature
- Door centerline offset: 560mm from fuselage centerline
- Approach angle: 90° ± 5° preferred
- Vertical alignment tolerance: ±150mm
- Horizontal alignment tolerance: ±100mm

---

## 3. JETWAY INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Jetway Types Compatible
- Type: Fixed gangway, mobile lounge, or air stairs
- Standard: ISO 16004 compatible
- Approach: Front or side approach capable
- Height adjustment: 1,800mm to 3,500mm

### 3.2 Canopy Interface
- Canopy type: Flexible weather seal
- Seal contact: Fuselage skin around door
- Seal compression: 50mm ±20mm
- Weather protection: Rain, wind, snow

---

## 4. DOCKING PROCEDURES

### 4.1 Approach Sequence
1. Aircraft chocks and parking brake set
2. Door opened from inside (ground crew coordinated)
3. Jetway positioned to door sill height
4. Canopy extended to fuselage contact
5. Seal inflated (if applicable)
6. Visual inspection before passenger boarding

### 4.2 Safety Requirements
- Jetway wheel chocks: Required when docked
- Door fully open: 180° verified
- Slide disarmed: Confirmed before docking
- Ground crew present: During initial docking

---

## 5. LOAD INTERFACE

### 5.1 Jetway Loads on Fuselage
- Canopy contact force: <50 N/m perimeter
- Seal inflation pressure: 5 psi maximum
- Wind loads: Design for 50 km/h gusts
- No hard contact: Seal only, no structure-to-structure

### 5.2 Passenger Loads
- Boarding rate: 30-50 passengers/minute
- Platform load: Design per local codes
- Emergency egress: 110 persons/90 seconds capability

---

## 6. CLEARANCES

### 6.1 Jetway Clearance Envelope
- Width at sill: 1,200mm minimum platform
- Height: 2,100mm minimum headroom
- Slope: 1:12 maximum (ADA compliant)
- Gap: <75mm door sill to jetway (bridged)

### 6.2 Servicing Clearance
- Ground equipment: Clear of jetway path
- Wing clearance: 2,000mm minimum
- Tail clearance: Monitored during positioning

---

## 7. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

### 7.1 Weather Sealing
- Rain protection: Full perimeter seal
- Wind protection: 60 km/h without water ingress
- Temperature range: -40°C to +50°C operation
- Snow/ice: Heated canopy option

### 7.2 Cabin Environment
- Climate control: Jetway conditioned air optional
- Noise: <75 dBA at door
- Lighting: Adequate for safe boarding

---

## 8. COMMUNICATION

### 8.1 Ground Crew Communication
- Interphone: Ground crew to flight deck
- Visual signals: Hand signals standardized
- Radio: Ground frequency monitored

### 8.2 Status Indication
- Door position: Visible from jetway operator position
- Slide status: Visual flag check before docking
- All clear: Before jetway retraction

---

## 9. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### 9.1 Rapid Jetway Retraction
- Retraction time: <60 seconds full retraction
- Emergency release: Manual override available
- Aircraft movement: Jetway must clear quickly

### 9.2 Emergency Evacuation
- Jetway evacuation: Use as primary exit if docked
- Slide deployment: Jetway must be retracted first
- Communication: Coordination essential

---

## 10. VERIFICATION

- [x] Dimensional compatibility verified at multiple airports
- [x] Docking procedure tested and documented
- [x] Emergency egress procedures validated
- [x] Weather protection tested

---

## 11. AIRPORT COMPATIBILITY

### 11.1 Verified Compatible Airports
- Major hubs: JFK, LAX, LHR, FRA, SIN (gate-specific)
- Regional: TBD based on jetway surveys
- New construction: Design specifications provided

### 11.2 Special Considerations
- BWB unique fuselage shape: May require jetway modifications
- Door location: Forward position, standard interface
- Multiple doors: L1 and R1 can be used simultaneously
