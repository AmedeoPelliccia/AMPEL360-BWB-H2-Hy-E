# Latch System - Remanufacturing Process
## PN-52-10-01-201000

### Overview
The latch system components are designed for remanufacturing to extend service life and reduce environmental impact. High-value materials (stainless steel) are retained through rebuild.

### Remanufacturable Components

| Part Number | Description | Remanufacture Rate | Cycles per Unit |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| PN-52-10-01-201001 | Latch Hook | 3x | Up to 75,000 cycles |
| PN-52-10-01-201002 | Latch Pin | 3x | Up to 75,000 cycles |
| PN-52-10-01-201003 | Spring Assembly | 1x | Up to 30,000 cycles |

### Remanufacturing Process

#### 1. Incoming Inspection
- Visual inspection for damage
- Dimensional inspection
- NDT inspection (magnetic particle)
- Functional test
- Accept/Reject decision

#### 2. Disassembly
- Remove springs and hardware
- Clean all components
- Segregate by material
- Document condition

#### 3. Component Processing

**Latch Hook (PN-52-10-01-201001):**
- Strip coating
- Inspect for cracks (MPI)
- Re-machine wear surfaces
- Shot peen
- Apply corrosion protection
- Re-coat per specification

**Latch Pin (PN-52-10-01-201002):**
- Inspect for wear
- Re-grind surfaces
- Heat treat if needed
- Apply hard chrome plating

**Spring Assembly (PN-52-10-01-201003):**
- Test spring rate
- Replace if out of specification
- Generally single-use

#### 4. Assembly
- Assemble with new wear parts
- Lubricate per specification
- Torque to specification
- Test operation

#### 5. Testing
- Load test to 120% of limit load
- Cycling test (100 cycles minimum)
- Dimensional verification
- Functional test

#### 6. Certification
- Issue new serial number suffix (-R1, -R2, -R3)
- Update Digital Passport
- Issue Certificate of Conformance
- Limited to 3 remanufacturing cycles

### Economic Analysis

#### First Life Costs
- New latch hook: €185
- New latch pin: €95
- New spring assembly: €42
- **Total:** €322

#### Remanufacturing Costs
- Inspection & testing: €45
- Processing & re-coating: €65
- New wear parts: €30
- Certification: €15
- **Total:** €155

**Savings:** €167 per cycle (52% reduction)

**Over 3 remanufacturing cycles:**
- Total cost: €322 + (3 × €155) = €787
- vs. 4 new units: 4 × €322 = €1,288
- **Total savings:** €501 (39%)

### Environmental Impact

#### Per Remanufactured Unit
- Material savings: 1.8 kg steel
- CO2 savings: 12 kg CO2e
- Energy savings: 95 MJ
- Waste reduction: 1.6 kg

#### Fleet Scale (100 aircraft, 4 doors, 3 remanufacturing cycles)
- Material savings: 2.16 tonnes steel
- CO2 savings: 14.4 tonnes CO2e
- Cost savings: €60,120

### Quality Control

#### Acceptance Criteria
- No cracks detected
- Wear within limits (0.5mm max)
- Surface finish Ra 3.2 µm max
- Hardness within specification
- Load test pass
- Functional test pass

#### Rejection Criteria
- Cracks detected
- Excessive wear (>0.5mm)
- Corrosion pitting
- Heat damage
- Already 3x remanufactured
