# Decommissioning Plan
## Door L1 Forward - End of Service Life

### Overview
This document outlines the systematic decommissioning process for Door L1 Forward at the end of its operational life, ensuring safe removal, proper documentation, and maximum value recovery.

### Triggers for Decommissioning

1. **Aircraft retirement** - End of airframe service life
2. **Economic repair limit exceeded** - Damage cost > 50% of replacement
3. **Obsolescence** - Technology no longer supportable
4. **Regulatory** - Airworthiness directive requiring replacement
5. **Upgrade program** - Fleet modernization initiative

### Pre-Decommissioning Assessment

#### Condition Survey
- Structural integrity assessment
- Component serviceability review
- Remaining useful life analysis
- Salvage value estimation
- Hazmat identification

#### Documentation Review
- Service history
- Modification records
- Maintenance logs
- Digital Product Passport data
- Serialized component tracking

### Decommissioning Process

#### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 days)

**Planning:**
- Obtain decommissioning authorization
- Schedule aircraft downtime
- Coordinate recycling facilities
- Prepare documentation package
- Assemble required tools and equipment

**Safety:**
- Lock out electrical power
- Tag aircraft as under maintenance
- Establish safety zones
- Brief work crew
- Stage disposal containers

#### Phase 2: Data Extraction (2-4 hours)

**Digital Systems:**
- Download CAOS operational data
- Extract maintenance logs
- Archive configuration files
- Deactivate software licenses
- Update Digital Product Passport

**Documentation:**
- Record final serial numbers
- Photograph condition
- Complete decommissioning checklist
- Initiate disposal certificates

#### Phase 3: Door Removal (4-8 hours)

**Disconnection:**
1. Disconnect electrical connectors
2. Disconnect pneumatic lines
3. Remove wiring harness
4. Disconnect control cables
5. Remove slide/escape system

**Structural Removal:**
1. Remove hinge pins
2. Disconnect latch fittings
3. Support door weight with hoist
4. Remove mounting fasteners
5. Extract door from opening

**Transport:**
- Secure door to transport frame
- Protect sensitive surfaces
- Transport to disassembly facility

#### Phase 4: Disassembly (1-2 days)

Follow detailed sequence in `Disassembly_Sequence.md`:

1. Electronics & Software (Phase 1)
2. Mechanical Systems (Phase 2)
3. Seals & Consumables (Phase 3)
4. Structural Components (Phase 4)

#### Phase 5: Material Processing (varies)

**Sorting:**
- Segregate by material type
- Separate hazmat components
- Identify reusable components
- Weigh and document each stream

**Certification:**
- Obtain weight certificates
- Complete hazmat manifests
- Document recycler details
- Track material destinations

#### Phase 6: Final Documentation (1 day)

**Completion:**
- Close work orders
- Update asset register
- File disposal certificates
- Close Digital Product Passport
- Archive all records

### Value Recovery Summary

| Stream | Weight (kg) | Recovery Value (EUR) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Titanium | 8.4 | 420 |
| Aluminum | 42.8 | 85 |
| CFRP | 51.6 | 155 |
| Copper | 2.1 | 19 |
| Electronics | 3.2 | 30 |
| Other metals | 5.9 | 12 |
| **Total** | **114.0** | **721** |

### Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Crew Size |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Pre-planning | 1-2 days | 2 |
| Data extraction | 2-4 hours | 2 |
| Door removal | 4-8 hours | 4 |
| Transport | Variable | 2 |
| Disassembly | 1-2 days | 3 |
| Processing | Variable | N/A |
| Documentation | 1 day | 1 |
| **Total** | **4-6 days** | |

### Cost Estimate

| Activity | Cost (EUR) |
|----------|------------|
| Labor (40 hours @ €75/hr) | 3,000 |
| Equipment & tools | 500 |
| Transport | 800 |
| Processing fees | 1,200 |
| Documentation | 300 |
| **Total Cost** | **5,800** |

**Net Cost:** €5,800 - €721 recovery = **€5,079**

### Regulatory Compliance

- FAA/EASA notification of removal
- WEEE documentation
- REACH declarations
- Hazmat transport permits
- Recycling certificates
- Environmental reporting

### Risk Mitigation

**Safety Risks:**
- Heavy lift operations → Use certified equipment
- Hazmat exposure → Full PPE, trained personnel
- Stored energy → Lockout/tagout procedures

**Environmental Risks:**
- Fluid spills → Spill kits staged
- Dust generation → Ventilation, filtration
- Waste contamination → Proper segregation

**Financial Risks:**
- Cost overruns → Fixed-price contracts with recyclers
- Value loss → Rapid processing to preserve materials
- Documentation gaps → Checklists and audits

### Lessons Learned Integration

After each decommissioning:
- Conduct debrief
- Document challenges
- Update procedures
- Improve tooling
- Optimize material recovery
- Feed data to CAOS for future predictions

### CAOS Optimization

- Predictive decommissioning scheduling
- Automated documentation
- Real-time material tracking
- Value recovery optimization
- Blockchain-verified disposal
- Carbon credit calculation
