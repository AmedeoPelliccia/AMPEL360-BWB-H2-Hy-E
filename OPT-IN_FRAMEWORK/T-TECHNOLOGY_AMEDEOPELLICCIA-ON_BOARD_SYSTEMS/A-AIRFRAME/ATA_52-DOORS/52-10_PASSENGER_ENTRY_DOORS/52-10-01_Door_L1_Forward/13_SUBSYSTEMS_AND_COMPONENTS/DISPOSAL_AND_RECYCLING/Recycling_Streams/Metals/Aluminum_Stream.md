| Various | Fasteners, brackets | 3.6 | Various | 1.50 |
| **Total** | | **42.8** | | **Avg: 2.00** |

### Recycling Process

#### 1. Disassembly
- Remove from door assembly
- Separate by alloy type
- Remove non-metallic attachments
- Document serial numbers for traceability

#### 2. Preparation
- Clean of oils, greases, sealants
- Remove paint/coatings (if required by recycler)
- Cut oversized pieces to manageable size
- Sort by alloy grade

#### 3. Sorting
- **7075 Series:** High-strength aerospace alloy (premium value)
- **6061 Series:** General purpose alloy (standard value)
- **2024 Series:** If present (premium value)
- Mixed alloys: Lower value, avoid if possible

#### 4. Recycling
- Melting temperature: 660°C
- Energy input: 5% of virgin aluminum production
- CO2 reduction: 95% vs. virgin production
- Material loss: <2%

### Quality Requirements

#### Acceptable Material
- Aluminum alloys 2xxx, 6xxx, 7xxx series
- Maximum contamination: 2%
- Maximum paint/coating: 5%
- Dry, free of oils

#### Unacceptable Contamination
- Steel fasteners (remove)
- Titanium inserts (remove)
- Composite laminates (separate)
- Excessive organics

### Environmental Impact

#### Per Door Unit (42.8 kg)
- Energy saved: 2,057 MJ
- CO2 avoided: 240 kg CO2e
- Water saved: 856 liters
- Bauxite mining avoided: 171 kg

#### Fleet Scale (100 aircraft × 4 doors)
- Energy saved: 824,000 MJ
- CO2 avoided: 96 tonnes
- Revenue: €34,240

### Economic Analysis

#### Revenue Calculation
```
7075-T6 alloy (38.4 kg): 38.4 × €2.10 = €80.64
6061-T6 alloy (0.8 kg):   0.8 × €1.80 = €1.44
Mixed/hardware (3.6 kg):  3.6 × €1.50 = €5.40
Total per door: €87.48
```

#### Processing Costs
- Collection & transport: €8.00
- Sorting & preparation: €6.00
- Documentation: €2.00
- Total cost: €16.00

**Net revenue:** €87.48 - €16.00 = **€71.48 per door**

### Approved Recyclers

| Company | Location | Capacity | Specialization | Certification |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| EuroMetal Recycling | Hamburg, DE | 50,000 t/year | Aerospace alloys | ISO 14001 |
| Aerospace Metals UK | Bristol, UK | 25,000 t/year | High-grade Al | ISO 14001, AS9120 |
| Constellium Recycling | Various EU | 100,000 t/year | All aluminum | ISO 14001 |

### Documentation

Required documents:
- Material transfer note
- Alloy composition certificate
- Weight receipt
- Recycling certificate
- Payment invoice
- Carbon credit certificate

### Traceability

Each batch tracked with:
- Source aircraft MSN
- Part numbers included
- Total weight by alloy
- Processing date
- Recycler facility
- Digital Passport update

### Best Practices

#### Maximizing Value
1. Keep alloys separated
2. Remove all non-aluminum materials
3. Clean to reduce contamination
4. Bundle similar alloys together
5. Document alloy grades clearly

#### Avoiding Downgrading
- Don't mix 2xxx, 6xxx, 7xxx series
- Remove anodized coatings for high-value recycling
- Separate cladded from bare material
- Keep aerospace grades separate from commercial

### CAOS Integration

- Automated weight tracking
- Alloy identification via spectroscopy
- Real-time market pricing
- Optimal batch scheduling
- Carbon accounting integration
- Blockchain-verified transactions

### Recovery Rates

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Material recovery | 98% | 98.5% |
| Alloy purity | 95% | 96.2% |
| Energy efficiency | 5% of virgin | 4.8% of virgin |
| Process time | 48 hours | 36 hours |

### Future Improvements

- On-site alloy verification equipment
- Direct recycler partnerships
- Blockchain payment automation
- Closed-loop recycling to aircraft grade
- 3D printing feedstock preparation
