# Overview: 01-20-07 - Hydrogen System Inspection Requirements

## 1.0 Purpose
This component establishes the scheduled inspection intervals and methodologies specific to the AMPEL360's cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH₂) storage, distribution, and fuel cell systems.

## 2.0 Regulatory Context
Hydrogen systems in commercial aviation are not yet standardized under conventional ATA frameworks. This component integrates:
- **ISO 19880-8:** Gaseous hydrogen fuel quality specifications (adapted for LH₂)
- **SAE ARP6418:** Fuel Cell Safety for Aircraft
- **EASA SC-Hydrogen:** Special Condition for hydrogen propulsion (pending)
- **NASA MSFC-SPEC-3012:** LH₂ system design standards

## 3.0 Inspection Categories

### 3.1 Cryogenic Tank Integrity
- **Visual:** Outer vessel insulation integrity checks (every 300 FH)
- **Leak Check:** Vacuum pressure decay test (every 1200 FH)
- **NDT:** Ultrasonic wall thickness measurement (every 4800 FH or 5 years)

### 3.2 Distribution System
- **Line Inspection:** Flexible line condition assessment (every 600 FH)
- **Valve Actuation Test:** All isolation valves (every 1200 FH)
- **Relief Valve Calibration:** Pressure relief devices (every 2400 FH)

### 3.3 Fuel Cell Stacks
- **Performance Test:** Output voltage/current mapping (every 600 FH)
- **Membrane Inspection:** Proton exchange membrane degradation check (every 2400 FH)
- **Stack Replacement:** Life limit at 18,000 FH or membrane resistance > threshold

## 4.0 Interfaces
- **ATA 28-30:** H₂ fuel storage tank maintenance
- **ATA 49-20:** Fuel cell APU integration
- **ATA 26-40:** H₂ leak detection system verification
- **ATA 12-10:** Servicing procedures for LH₂

## 5.0 Safety Considerations
All hydrogen system inspections require:
- Personnel certified in cryogenic fluid handling
- Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Isolation of system from H₂ source
- Nitrogen purging before opening any H₂ components
- Continuous gas detection monitoring

## 6.0 Documentation Requirements
Each inspection must be documented with:
- Inspection date and flight hours at inspection
- Inspector name and certification number
- Inspection findings and corrective actions
- Approval signature from authorized inspector
- Cross-reference to task card number

## 7.0 Revision History
- **Rev 1.0** (2025-10-31): Initial release for AMPEL360 program
