# ATA 01: Maintenance Policy Information

**CRITICAL GOVERNANCE NOTE:** This chapter defines the maintenance philosophy, scheduled maintenance program, and policy framework for the AMPEL360 aircraft. It establishes the baseline for all maintenance planning, inspection intervals, and continuous airworthiness management.

## Scope and Structure
ATA 01 provides the strategic framework that governs how the aircraft is maintained throughout its operational life. It bridges regulatory requirements (EASA Part-M, FAA Part 43/91) with the unique technological characteristics of the AMPEL360's hydrogen-electric propulsion, BWB airframe, and CO₂ circular systems.

## The 14-Folder Skeleton
Every 6-digit component within this chapter represents a formal policy, program, or data set that is subject to certification authority approval. Each component is managed through the full lifecycle skeleton, ensuring requirements traceability, design rationale, verification evidence, and regulatory compliance artifacts are maintained.

## Integration with Other Chapters
- **ATA 04 (Airworthiness Limitations):** Hard limits derived from ATA 01 policies
- **ATA 05 (Time Limits/Maintenance Checks):** Specific intervals implementing ATA 01 programs
- **ATA 45 (OMS/CMS):** Real-time systems monitoring maintenance requirements
- **ATA 92 (Model-Based Maintenance):** Predictive analytics enhancing ATA 01 programs

## Hydrogen-Specific Considerations
The AMPEL360's cryogenic H₂ systems and solid-CO₂ battery technology require novel maintenance approaches not covered by conventional ATA standards. These are formally documented within provisional subsections and cross-referenced to:
- ATA 28 (Fuel) for H₂ storage and distribution
- ATA 24 (Electrical Power) for CO₂ battery modules
- ATA 47 (Inerting System) for ullage management
