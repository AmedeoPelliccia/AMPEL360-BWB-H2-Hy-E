## Purpose  
Define the guiding principles governing the maintenance and operational support strategy of the AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E program.  
The philosophy establishes a balanced approach between safety assurance, system availability, cost efficiency, and sustainability across the aircraft life cycle.

## Philosophy Overview  
The maintenance program philosophy is **condition-based, data-driven, and digitally traceable**, aligning with both **EASA Part-M/Part-CAMO** and **FAA 14 CFR Part 25** continuing airworthiness frameworks.  

Key tenets:  
1. **Predictive over reactive.** Maintenance intervals are driven by real-time health monitoring and digital-twin analytics.  
2. **Configuration integrity.** Every component is tracked through the EU Digital Product Passport and AMPEL360 asset-management blockchain.  
3. **Integrated safety logic.** The program derives all maintenance tasks from FHA, PSSA, and MSG-3 analyses.  
4. **Circularity commitment.** End-of-life recovery, reuse, and recycling are embedded into every maintenance decision.  
5. **Continuous learning.** Field data automatically refines reliability models and future inspection criteria.  
6. **Hybrid-energy focus.** Specific attention to H₂ fuel-cell stacks, cryogenic subsystems, and CO₂-battery modules through specialized condition-monitoring procedures.  
7. **Unified standards baseline.** Procedures harmonize **ATA 100/iSpec 2200**, **S1000D Issue 6**, **AS9100**, and **DO-178C/254** processes for airworthiness evidence traceability.

## Implementation Principles  
- Maintenance tasks shall be modular, referenced by ATA-chapter, and fully traceable in the OPT-IN framework.  
- Digital-twin synchronization ensures each inspection event updates both the configuration status and performance baselines.  
- Sustainability metrics (CO₂ savings, material reuse rates) are logged as part of the maintenance record.  
- Program reviews are triggered by reliability trend thresholds rather than fixed calendar intervals.

## Expected Outcome  
A maintenance ecosystem that:  
- Reduces unscheduled removals by >30 %.  
- Achieves verifiable zero-emission compliance through optimized hybrid operations.  
- Provides real-time airworthiness status visibility to regulators, operators, and OEM engineering.
