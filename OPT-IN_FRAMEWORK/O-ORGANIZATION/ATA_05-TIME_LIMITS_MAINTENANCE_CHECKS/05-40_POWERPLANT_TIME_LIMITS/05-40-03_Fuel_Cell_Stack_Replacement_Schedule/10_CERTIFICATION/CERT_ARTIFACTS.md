## 1.0 MSG-3 Analysis Report

**Document ID:** AMPEL-MSG3-FC-001  
**Revision:** C  
**Date:** 2024-04-18  
**Authors:** Maintenance Steering Group 3 Task Force (AMPEL360 + Operators)

### 1.1 System Analysis
**System:** ATA 49-21 - Fuel Cell Propulsion System  
**Significant Item:** Fuel cell stack assembly (P/N 49-100-001)  
**Function:** Convert H₂ + O₂ to electrical power for propulsion motors

### 1.2 Failure Mode Evaluation

| Failure Mode | Consequence | Detection | MSG-3 Decision |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Membrane degradation | Reduced power output | Performance test | Hard Time + OC |
| Catalyst poisoning | Efficiency loss | Performance test | Hard Time + OC |
| Coolant leak | Overheating, shutdown | Leak detection system | On-Condition |
| Seal failure | H₂ crossover, safety risk | Gas leak detector | On-Condition |
| Bipolar plate corrosion | Cell voltage imbalance | Cell voltage monitoring | Hard Time + CM |

### 1.3 Task Selection Rationale

**Hard Time Interval:** 18,000 FH  
**Justification:**
- Fuel cell stacks exhibit predictable wear-out characteristics
- Performance degradation curve is well-established from test data
- Economic analysis shows replacement at 18,000 FH optimizes lifecycle cost
- Safety margin: Replacement before failure probability exceeds 10⁻⁶ per FH

**Supplementary Tasks:**
- **OC Tasks:** 600 FH performance validation tests detect off-nominal degradation
- **CM Tasks:** Real-time ACMS monitoring provides early warning of anomalies

### 1.4 Interval Adjustment Provision
MSG-3 analysis permits interval extension to 21,000 FH if:
1. Fleet reliability data supports (minimum 200,000 FH across ≥5 aircraft)
2. No unscheduled removals due to performance degradation
3. Impedance spectroscopy trends remain within statistical bounds
4. Economic analysis remains favorable

**Approval Required:** EASA Part-M approval + revised MPD publication

## 2.0 Reliability Analysis

**Document ID:** AMPEL-REL-FC-002  
**Revision:** B  
**Date:** 2024-08-30  
**Data Source:** Development aircraft fleet (5 aircraft, 150,000 total FH)

### 2.1 Weibull Analysis
**Population:** 8 fuel cell stacks (2 removed early for leak, not performance)

**Results:**
- **Shape Parameter (β):** 3.2 (wear-out mode confirmed)
- **Scale Parameter (η):** 21,400 FH (characteristic life)
- **B10 Life:** 16,850 FH (10% probability of degradation beyond threshold)
- **B1 Life:** 14,200 FH (1% probability)

**Retirement Interval Selection:**  
18,000 FH places interval between B10 and η, providing robust reliability while maximizing utilization.

### 2.2 Economic Analysis
**Total Cost of Ownership (per stack):**
- **Acquisition Cost:** $850,000 USD
- **Installation Labor:** $12,000 USD (40 man-hours @ $300/hr)
- **Downtime Cost:** $180,000 USD (3 days aircraft unavailable @ $60K/day)
- **Total Replacement Cost:** $1,042,000 USD

**Performance Degradation Penalty:**
- At 18,000 FH: +2% H₂ fuel consumption vs. new stack
- At 21,000 FH: +8% H₂ fuel consumption vs. new stack
- H₂ fuel cost: $12/kg (2024 prices, European average)
- Annual H₂ consumption: ~250,000 kg per aircraft (6,000 FH/year operation)

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Extended operation 18,000→21,000 FH saves $1.04M (deferred replacement)
- Fuel penalty 18,000→21,000 FH costs ~$720K (3,000 FH × 250 kg/FH × 8% × $12/kg)
- **Net Benefit:** $320K saved by delaying replacement
- **However:** Safety margins and fleet standardization favor 18,000 FH retirement

**Conclusion:**  
18,000 FH interval selected for fleet-wide standardization and safety margin preservation. Individual operators may request 21,000 FH extension via engineering order process.
