# Overview: 05-40-03 - Fuel Cell Stack Replacement Schedule

## 1.0 Purpose
This component establishes the scheduled replacement intervals for the AMPEL360's Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stacks, which convert liquid hydrogen to electrical power for propulsion and aircraft systems.

## 2.0 Replacement Intervals

### 2.1 Primary Interval
**REPLACE FUEL CELL STACK: 18,000 flight hours OR when impedance spectroscopy indicates >30% power degradation, whichever occurs first.**

### 2.2 Inspection Intervals (Prior to Replacement)
| Task | Interval | Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Visual Inspection (External) | 600 FH | AMM 49-21-00-220-001 |
| Performance Validation Test | 600 FH | AMM 49-21-00-710-003 |
| Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis | 600 FH | AMM 49-21-00-710-005 |
| Coolant System Pressure Test | 1,200 FH | AMM 49-21-00-710-007 |
| Membrane Hydration Verification | 1,200 FH | AMM 49-21-00-710-009 |
| Stack Module Replacement (individual cell) | On-Condition | AMM 49-21-00-400-010 |

### 2.3 Supplementary Limits
- **Thermal Cycles:** Maximum 24,000 thermal cycles (cold start events)
- **Calendar Limit:** 12 years from date of manufacture (environmental degradation)
- **Performance Threshold:** If voltage drops below 0.65V/cell at rated current, stack must be replaced within 100 FH

## 3.0 Rationale

### 3.1 Life Limit Basis
Fuel cell stack life is governed by:
- **Membrane Degradation:** Nafion® membrane thinning due to chemical attack
- **Catalyst Poisoning:** Platinum catalyst surface area reduction
- **Carbon Corrosion:** Bipolar plate oxidation at high potentials
- **Seal Degradation:** Gasket compression set and hydrogen crossover

### 3.2 Service Experience
Pre-certification testing on development aircraft (tail numbers 9001-9003):
- **Average Stack Life:** 19,200 FH before reaching 30% degradation threshold
- **Scatter Factor:** 1.25 (minimum observed life: 15,360 FH)
- **Design Life:** 18,000 FH provides adequate margin

### 3.3 Economic Optimization
Stack replacement at 18,000 FH balances:
- **Direct Costs:** Stack module cost (~$850K USD per aircraft)
- **Indirect Costs:** Performance degradation increases H₂ fuel consumption
- **Break-Even Analysis:** Fuel cost penalties exceed replacement cost at ~19,500 FH

## 4.0 Operational Impact

### 4.1 Unscheduled Removal Rate
Based on fleet data (150,000 total FH across 5 aircraft):
- **Premature Failures:** 2 stacks removed early due to coolant leak (not performance)
- **Calculated URR:** 0.13 per 1,000 FH (target: <0.20)

### 4.2 Shop Visit Planning
Fuel cell stack replacement is typically bundled with:
- **C-Check (9,000 FH):** Replace stack at 2× C-Check (18,000 FH)
- **D-Check (36,000 FH):** Second stack replacement coincides with D-Check

### 4.3 Logistics Requirements
- **Lead Time:** 180 days (stack manufactured on-demand by OEM)
- **Exchange Pool:** Operators should maintain 1 spare stack per 3 aircraft
- **Core Return:** Used stacks returned to OEM for refurbishment analysis (no credit)

## 5.0 Replacement Procedure Overview

### 5.1 Pre-Removal Tasks
1. Aircraft electrical system powered down per AMM 24-00-00-840-001
2. H₂ fuel system purged with GN₂ per AMM 28-00-00-860-002
3. Coolant system drained per AMM 49-21-00-460-001
4. High-voltage disconnect performed per AMM 24-20-00-840-005

### 5.2 Removal Steps (Summary)
- **Access:** Remove belly fairing panels (ATA 53)
- **Disconnect:** Electrical harnesses (48 connectors), coolant lines (8 quick-disconnects), H₂ supply lines (2 flanges)
- **Support:** Install lifting fixture (P/N 49-100-LIFT-001)
- **Extraction:** Lower stack assembly on sling (weight: 850 kg)
- **Duration:** 18 man-hours (2-person crew)

### 5.3 Installation Steps (Summary)
- **Preparation:** Verify new stack serial number and shipping preservation removal
- **Lifting:** Raise stack into position using lifting fixture
- **Connection:** Torque all bolts per torque table (AMM Figure 49-21-00-400)
- **Testing:** Perform leak test (H₂ + coolant), electrical continuity, insulation resistance
- **Functional Test:** Ground run at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% power (2-hour test cycle)
- **Duration:** 22 man-hours (2-person crew) + 2 hours test run

### 5.4 Documentation Requirements
- Aircraft logbook entry: "Fuel cell stack S/N XXXX removed at 18,050 FH. Stack S/N YYYY installed. Zero-time entry per ATA 05-40-03."
- Component logbook: Transfer previous stack's history to archive
- AMTS update: Reset fuel cell stack timer to zero
- Quality record: Torque sheet, leak test report, functional test report signed by certifying mechanic

## 6.0 MSG-3 Analysis Summary

### 6.1 Failure Mode Analysis
**Failure Mode:** Fuel cell stack power output degradation  
**Failure Effect:** Reduced electrical power availability, increased H₂ consumption  
**FMEA Severity:** Category 3 (Major - Flight crew actions required)  
**Likelihood:** Frequent (multiple occurrences per 1,000 FH if not managed)

**MSG-3 Decision:**
- **Hard Time:** YES - Stack has predictable wear-out mechanism
- **On-Condition:** Supplement with performance monitoring (600 FH tests)
- **Condition Monitoring:** Real-time voltage/current monitoring via ACMS

### 6.2 Task Development Rationale
Scheduled replacement at 18,000 FH prevents in-service power degradation below acceptable thresholds while maintaining economic viability of hydrogen propulsion system.
