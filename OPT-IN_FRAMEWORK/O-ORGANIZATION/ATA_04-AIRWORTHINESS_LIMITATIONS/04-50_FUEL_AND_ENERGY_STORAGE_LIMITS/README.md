# 04-50: Fuel and Energy Storage Limits

## Section Overview
This section contains airworthiness limitations for hydrogen fuel storage, battery systems, and fuel cell components unique to the AMPEL360 hybrid-electric propulsion system. These limitations address novel technologies not covered by conventional ATA standards.

## Regulatory Basis
- **EASA Special Condition - Hydrogen:** Cryogenic fuel system requirements
- **CS-25.981:** Fuel Tank Ignition Prevention (H₂ adapted)
- **CS-25.963:** Fuel Tank Tests
- **SAE AIR7396:** Fuel Cell Systems for Aviation
- **UN/DOT 38.3:** Battery Safety Requirements

## Unique AMPEL360 Considerations
The hydrogen-electric propulsion system introduces life-limiting factors not present in conventional jet fuel aircraft:

### Cryogenic Effects
- **Temperature:** LH₂ stored at -253°C (20K)
- **Thermal Cycling:** Each refuel imposes severe thermal shock
- **Material Embrittlement:** Hydrogen absorption degrades metal properties
- **Vacuum Degradation:** MLI insulation loses effectiveness over time

### Electrochemical Degradation
- **Fuel Cell Membranes:** Proton exchange membranes degrade with use
- **Battery Capacity Fade:** Solid-CO₂ batteries lose capacity over cycles
- **High Voltage Stress:** 800V DC systems require dielectric monitoring

## Components in This Section

### 04-50-01: LH₂ Tank Inner Vessel Life Limit ⭐ DETAILED EXAMPLE
**Limitation:** 50,000 flight cycles OR 20 calendar years OR 75,000 thermal cycles
- **Reason:** Fatigue + hydrogen embrittlement + thermal cycling
- **Material:** Al-Li 2195 alloy (space shuttle heritage)
- **Test Basis:** Full-scale fatigue test to 147,350 cycles (3× safety margin)
- **Consequence:** Safe-life component, no inspection can extend life

### 04-50-02: Vacuum Insulation Integrity Threshold
**Limitation:** Remove tank if vacuum pressure > 10⁻³ torr
- **Reason:** Vacuum loss increases boil-off rate (thermal performance degradation)
- **Monitoring:** Continuous vacuum pressure sensor
- **Action:** Inspect MLI, re-evacuate if possible, otherwise replace tank

### 04-50-03: Cryogenic Line Flexible Joint Limit
**Limitation:** 30,000 thermal cycles or 15 years
- **Component:** Bellows-type expansion joints in LH₂ piping
- **Reason:** Low-cycle fatigue from thermal expansion/contraction
- **Material:** Inconel 625 (cryogenic rated)

### 04-50-04: Solid CO₂ Battery Module Retirement
**Limitation:** 5,000 charge/discharge cycles or 80% capacity fade
- **Technology:** Novel reversible CO₂ capture battery system
- **Monitoring:** Battery management system (BMS) tracks cycles and capacity
- **Reason:** Electrochemical degradation of solid electrolyte

### 04-50-05: High Voltage Battery Capacity Threshold
**Limitation:** Replace when capacity < 80% of rated (or 10 years)
- **Battery Type:** Lithium-ion or solid-state battery pack (800V DC)
- **Safety:** Thermal runaway risk increases as cells age
- **Testing:** Annual capacity test required after 5 years

### 04-50-06: Thermal Cycling Accumulated Limit
**Limitation:** Combined thermal damage index from all cryogenic components
- **Method:** Palmgren-Miner cumulative damage rule
- **Tracking:** FMS calculates damage equivalent from each thermal event
- **Action:** Triggers enhanced inspection when 75% of limit reached

## Hydrogen Safety Considerations

### Leak Detection Requirements
All H₂ fuel system components are monitored by redundant leak detection:
- **Sensor Type:** Catalytic bead or thermal conductivity
- **Coverage:** 100% of enclosed spaces containing H₂
- **Alert:** Automatic shutdown if concentration > 1% by volume (25% LEL)

### Fire/Explosion Prevention
Hydrogen has unique hazards compared to Jet-A:
- **Lower Explosive Limit (LEL):** 4% in air (vs. 0.6% for Jet-A)
- **Ignition Energy:** 0.02 mJ (vs. 0.24 mJ for Jet-A)
- **Flame Visibility:** Nearly invisible in daylight

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ventilation: 30 air changes per hour in H₂ compartments
- Inerting: GN₂ purge capability for maintenance
- Bonding: All metallic components electrically bonded (< 2.5 milliohms)

### Cryogenic Hazards
Liquid hydrogen presents unique handling challenges:
- **Frostbite Risk:** Contact with LH₂ or cold surfaces causes instant tissue damage
- **Embrittlement:** Many materials become brittle at cryogenic temperatures
- **Asphyxiation:** Displaced oxygen in confined spaces

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**
- Cryogenic gloves (rated to -253°C)
- Face shield (full coverage)
- Insulated coveralls
- Safety shoes (non-slip, insulated)

## Fuel Cell System Life Limits

4. Calculate: (Actual capacity / Rated capacity) × 100%

**Retirement Criteria:**

**Life Limit Impact:** May extend to 10,000 cycles or 15 years with new chemistry

### Alternative Fuels
AMPEL360 design accommodates future fuel options:
- **Methanol:** Can use fuel cell, easier handling than LH₂
- **Ammonia:** High energy density, carbon-free
- **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF):** Drop-in replacement for Jet-A

**Life Limit Impact:** Different materials and thermal cycles would require new limits
