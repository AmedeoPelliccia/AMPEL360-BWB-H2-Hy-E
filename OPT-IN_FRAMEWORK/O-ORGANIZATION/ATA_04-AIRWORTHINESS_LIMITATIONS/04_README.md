# ATA 04: Airworthiness Limitations

**CRITICAL GOVERNANCE NOTE:** This chapter contains MANDATORY limitations that must be complied with to maintain the aircraft's type certification. Non-compliance with ATA 04 requirements renders the aircraft unairworthy and grounds the aircraft immediately.

## Regulatory Authority
ATA 04 implements:
- **EASA Part-26 (Certification Specifications):** Mandatory Continuing Airworthiness Information (MCAI)
- **FAA AC 120-93:** Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of Instructions for Continued Airworthiness
- **14 CFR §25.1529:** Instructions for Continued Airworthiness
- **EASA CS-25.1529:** ICA including Airworthiness Limitations

## Scope and Structure
This chapter defines absolute limits that cannot be exceeded without specific engineering authorization and regulatory approval. These include:
- **Life Limits:** Component retirement times (flight hours, cycles, calendar time)
- **Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMRs):** Tasks essential to preserve design certification basis
- **Inspection Thresholds:** Damage tolerance and fatigue critical structure
- **EWIS Aging:** Electrical wiring interconnection system limitations
- **Special Inspections:** System-specific limitations for novel technologies

## The 14-Folder Skeleton
Every 6-digit component represents a legally binding limitation set. Each component is managed through the full lifecycle skeleton to ensure requirements traceability from certification analysis, design substantiation, verification evidence, and regulatory approval documentation.

## Integration with Other Chapters
- **ATA 01 (Maintenance Policy):** Policy framework implementing ATA 04 limits
- **ATA 05 (Time Limits/Maintenance Checks):** Scheduled tasks executing ATA 04 requirements
- **ATA 51 (Structures):** Structural inspection programs mandated by ATA 04
- **ATA 28 (Fuel):** H₂ cryogenic tank life limits
- **ATA 24 (Electrical Power):** CO₂ battery module retirement criteria

## AMPEL360-Specific Considerations
The hydrogen-electric propulsion system and BWB composite airframe introduce novel airworthiness limitations not addressed by conventional ATA standards:

### Cryogenic Systems
- **Thermal Cycling Limits:** LH₂ tank insulation vacuum integrity degradation
- **Material Embrittlement:** Cold-affected structure inspection thresholds
- **Boil-Off Management:** Ullage control system life limits

### Composite BWB Structure
- **Impact Damage Tolerance:** BVID (Barely Visible Impact Damage) inspection intervals
- **Environmental Degradation:** Moisture ingress limits for sandwich panels
- **Load Path Criticality:** Primary structure fatigue life for non-redundant BWB load paths

### Energy Storage
- **Solid-CO₂ Battery Life:** Thermal cycle limits and capacity fade thresholds
- **Fuel Cell Membrane:** Proton exchange membrane degradation limits
- **High-Voltage EWIS:** Insulation resistance minimums for 800V DC systems

## Compliance Verification
All limitations in this chapter are substantiated by:
- **Full-Scale Fatigue Test (FSFT):** Structural life demonstration
- **Damage Tolerance Analysis:** Crack growth and residual strength evaluations
- **System Safety Assessment:** Failure mode effects analysis per ARP4761
- **Service Experience:** Fleet leader program and reliability monitoring

## Amendment Process
Changes to ATA 04 limitations require:
1. Engineering substantiation (stress analysis, testing, or service data)
2. Safety assessment update
3. Regulatory authority approval (EASA TC/STC amendment or FAA AD/AMOC)
4. Operator notification via Service Bulletin (mandatory compliance)
