# 04-10: Structural Life Limits

## Section Overview
This section contains airworthiness limitations for structural components that are designated as **safe-life** items. These components must be retired from service at specified life limits regardless of their apparent condition.

## Regulatory Basis
- **CS-25.571:** Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation
- **CS-25.571(b):** Safe-life components must be replaced at specified intervals
- **AC 23.573-1C:** Fatigue Test Development, Evaluation, and Approval

## Safe-Life Philosophy
Safe-life components are designed such that:
1. Catastrophic failure is extremely improbable during design service life
2. Safety factor of 3× minimum on test life (or analysis if testing impractical)
3. No inspection program can restore component life
4. Retirement is mandatory at specified limit

## Components in This Section

### 04-10-01: Safe Life Components (General)
General guidance on safe-life component identification, tracking, and retirement requirements.

### 04-10-02: Landing Gear Life Limits
**Limitation:** Main and nose landing gear retirement criteria
- **Typical Limit:** 60,000 landings or 25 years

**Limitation:** Propulsor and APU mount structure retirement
- **Typical Limit:** 75,000 flight hours or 20 years
- **Critical Features:** Engine attach fittings, vibration isolators
- **Reason:** High-cycle fatigue from vibration

### 04-10-05: BWB Center Body Life Limit
**Limitation:** Primary load-carrying structure of blended wing body
- **Typical Limit:** 120,000 flight cycles or 30 years
- **Critical Features:** Pressurization frames, keel beam, carry-through structure
- **Reason:** Non-redundant load paths, pressurization cycling
- **AMPEL360 Specific:** Composite construction requires damage tolerance demonstration

### 04-10-06: Wing Root Attachment Limit
**Limitation:** Wing-to-fuselage attachment structure
- **Typical Limit:** 150,000 flight cycles or 30 years
- **Critical Features:** Wing spar caps, attachment fittings, primary fasteners
- **Reason:** High stress concentration at wing root

### 04-10-07: Cryogenic Tank Support Structure
**Limitation:** LH₂ tank mounting structure life limit
- **Typical Limit:** 50,000 flight cycles or 20 years (tied to tank life)
- **Critical Features:** Support lugs, clevis fittings, attachment frames
- **Reason:** Thermal cycling fatigue, cryogenic embrittlement
- **AMPEL360 Specific:** Unique to hydrogen-fueled aircraft

## Implementation Requirements

### Operator Responsibilities
1. **Tracking:** Establish cycle counting system for all safe-life components
2. **Recording:** Maintain installation date and cycle count in logbook
3. **Alerts:** Configure ACMS to warn at 95% of life limit
4. **Compliance:** Ground aircraft if limit exceeded
5. **Replacement:** Procure replacement parts with adequate lead time

### Maintenance Organization Responsibilities
1. **Installation:** Record zero-time entry for new components
2. **Removal:** Document cycle count and reason for removal at life limit
3. **Inspection:** NOT APPLICABLE - inspection cannot extend life
4. **Disposition:** Return retired components to OEM for analysis (if required)

### OEM Responsibilities
1. **Life Determination:** Establish limits based on test and analysis
2. **Service Bulletins:** Issue mandatory compliance SBs if limit revised
3. **Fleet Monitoring:** Track service data from fleet leader aircraft
4. **Lessons Learned:** Analyze retired components for unexpected degradation

## BWB-Specific Considerations

### Composite Structure Life Limits
The AMPEL360 BWB center body is constructed primarily of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. Life limits for composite structure differ from metallic structure:

**Damage Tolerance Approach:**
- BVID (Barely Visible Impact Damage) must be detectable before growth to critical size
- Compression-after-impact (CAI) strength must be maintained
- Environmental degradation (moisture, UV) must be bounded

**Inspection Intervals:**
- Unlike safe-life metallic components, composite structure may require periodic inspection
- Inspection findings can trigger corrective action but do not extend original life limit

**Life Limit Rationale:**
- Based on environmental degradation testing (hygrothermal aging)
- Matrix cracking and delamination growth under fatigue
- Loss of mechanical properties over time (fiber-matrix debonding)

### Cryogenic Effects on Structure
LH₂ tanks operate at -253°C, affecting adjacent structure:

**Cold Soak Zone:** Structure within 1 meter of tank experiences thermal cycling
- **Material Selection:** Al-Li or stainless steel (no ductile-brittle transition)
- **Life Reduction:** 30% reduction in fatigue life due to thermal stress
- **Inspection Requirements:** Enhanced inspection for cold-affected zones

**Thermal Barriers:**
- MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) limits thermal conduction
- Thermal stand-offs in support structure minimize cold transfer
- Monitoring: Temperature sensors verify thermal barriers effective

## Compliance Tracking

### Cycle Counting Methods
**Automated (Primary):**
- ACMS records flight cycles from weight-on-wheels sensor
- FMS records thermal cycles for cryogenic components
- Data stored in non-volatile memory with 99.999% reliability

**Manual (Secondary):**
- Logbook entry each flight (flight crew responsibility)
- Monthly reconciliation of ACMS vs. logbook
- Quarterly audit by maintenance organization

### Alert System
**ACMS Caution/Warning Levels:**
- **Advisory (95%):** Maintenance planning alert
- **Caution (98%):** Confirm replacement part availability
- **Warning (100%):** Engine start inhibit, aircraft grounded

### Replacement Planning
**Lead Time Considerations:**
- Major structural components: 12-18 month lead time
- Actuators and gear: 6-9 month lead time
- Operators should initiate procurement at 85% of limit

## Regulatory Compliance

### Type Certificate Limitations
All life limits in this section are incorporated into:
- **Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS):** Section IV - Limitations
- **Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS):** Mandatory compliance document
- **Maintenance Review Board (MRB) Report:** Task cards for replacement

### Operator Maintenance Program
Per Part-M.A.302 (EASA) or 14 CFR 121.367 (FAA):
- All ALS limitations must be incorporated into operator's maintenance program
- No deviations permitted without regulatory approval
- Compliance verification during authority audits

### Non-Compliance Consequences
- **Certificate of Airworthiness:** Immediate suspension
- **Operator Certificate:** Subject to suspension or revocation
- **Civil Penalties:** Up to €4,000/day (EASA) or $50,000/violation (FAA)
- **Criminal Liability:** Possible if results in accident

## Future Life Extension
Life limits may be extended based on:
1. **Service Experience:** Fleet data shows actual life exceeds predicted
2. **Improved Analysis:** Better understanding of degradation mechanisms
3. **Enhanced Inspection:** New NDT methods detect smaller defects
4. **Material Improvements:** Upgraded materials in later production

**Process:**
- Engineering substantiation (test or analysis)
- Safety assessment update
- Regulatory approval (TC amendment)
- Service Bulletin (mandatory compliance)
