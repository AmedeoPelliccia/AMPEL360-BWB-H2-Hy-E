# ATA 00: GENERAL

**Aircraft Platform**: AMPEL360 BWB H2 Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA  
**Framework**: OPT-IN AMEDEOPELLICCIA  
**Domain**: O-ORGANIZATION  
**Revision**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-31  

## Critical Governance Note

This chapter establishes the foundational principles, standards, and top-level data for the entire AMPEL360 program. It serves as the master reference for the documentation system itself and provides high-level context for all other ATA chapters.

## Purpose

ATA 00 defines:
- Aircraft general information and description
- Overall systems architecture
- Performance envelope
- Weight and balance fundamentals
- Operational limitations
- Documentation standards and cross-references
- Regulatory certification basis

## The 14-Folder Skeleton

Every 6-digit component within this chapter is a self-contained project managed by the standard 14-folder lifecycle skeleton:

1. **01_OVERVIEW** - Purpose, scope, and summary
2. **02_SAFETY** - Safety analysis and hazard identification
3. **03_REQUIREMENTS** - Formal requirements and traceability
4. **04_DESIGN** - Design rationale and standards
5. **05_INTERFACES** - Interface control documents
6. **06_ENGINEERING** - Technical basis and calculations
7. **07_V_AND_V** - Verification and validation
8. **08_PROTOTYPING** - Prototypes and drafts
9. **09_PRODUCTION_PLANNING** - Production readiness
10. **10_CERTIFICATION** - Regulatory compliance evidence
11. **11_OPERATIONS_AND_MAINTENANCE** - Operational procedures
12. **12_ASSETS_MANAGEMENT** - Configuration and version control
13. **13_SUBSYSTEMS_AND_COMPONENTS** - Breakdown and dependencies
14. **14_META_GOVERNANCE** - Change control and audit trail

This ensures that even high-level documentation like "Aircraft Description" or "Performance Data" is subject to the same rigorous governance as physical hardware components.

## Integration with OPT-IN Framework

ATA 00 sits within the **O-ORGANIZATION** domain of the OPT-IN framework, providing the organizational foundation for all downstream technical domains (T-TECHNOLOGY, P-PROGRAM, I-INFRASTRUCTURES, N-NEURAL NETWORKS).

## Certification Authority References

- **EASA**: CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes)
- **FAA**: 14 CFR Part 25
- **Special Conditions**: Hydrogen fuel systems, BWB configuration
- **Equivalent Safety Findings**: CO₂ capture systems
