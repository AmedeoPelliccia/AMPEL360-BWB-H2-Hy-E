# RQ-40-06 â€” Environmental (ISO 14001 / 50001)

## Statement
Aircraft development and operations shall implement **ISO 14001** (Environmental Management Systems) and **ISO 50001** (Energy Management Systems) to minimize environmental impact, optimize energy efficiency, and demonstrate sustainability management throughout the aircraft lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS)**  
   - **Policy and objectives:** Environmental policy committing to pollution prevention, legal compliance, and continuous improvement.  
   - **Lifecycle perspective:** Environmental impacts assessed across design, manufacturing, operations, maintenance, disposal.  
   - **Key impacts managed:** Greenhouse gas emissions (COâ‚‚, NOâ‚“, PM), noise, waste, resource consumption.  
   - **Legal compliance:** Compliance with environmental regulations (ICAO Annex 16, EU ETS, local airport environmental rules).  
   - **Continuous improvement:** Environmental performance monitored via KPIs; improvement targets set and tracked.

2. **ISO 50001 Energy Management System (EnMS)**  
   - **Energy policy:** Commitment to energy efficiency improvement in design and operations.  
   - **Energy baseline:** Establish energy performance baseline (fuel/energy per seat-km) for aircraft operations.  
   - **Energy targets:** Continuous improvement targets for operational energy efficiency (e.g., â‰¥ 2% annual improvement).  
   - **Energy monitoring:** Real-time energy monitoring via digital twin (**RQ-30-01**); operational data analysis identifies efficiency opportunities.

3. **Sustainability Performance Metrics**  
   - **In-flight emissions:** 0 g COâ‚‚/km in Hâ‚‚ mode (**RQ-20-01**); track and report lifecycle emissions (including Hâ‚‚ production).  
   - **Noise footprint:** -25 dB vs. CS-36 (**RQ-20-04**); community noise impact modeling and reporting.  
   - **Resource efficiency:** Fuel efficiency, water usage, waste generation tracked and optimized.  
   - **Circular economy:** Component reuse, recycling, and end-of-life management per DPP (**RQ-30-02**).

4. **Certification and Auditing**  
   - **ISO 14001/50001 certification:** Third-party certification by accredited body (e.g., BSI, TÃœV).  
   - **Annual audits:** Internal and external audits ensure ongoing compliance and continuous improvement.  
   - **Management review:** Top management reviews environmental and energy performance annually; sets new targets.

5. **Stakeholder Communication**  
   - **Sustainability reporting:** Annual sustainability report per GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) or equivalent framework.  
   - **Regulatory reporting:** COâ‚‚ emissions reporting per CORSIA, EU ETS, and local regulations.  
   - **Customer transparency:** Operators provided with aircraft environmental performance data for their sustainability reporting.
