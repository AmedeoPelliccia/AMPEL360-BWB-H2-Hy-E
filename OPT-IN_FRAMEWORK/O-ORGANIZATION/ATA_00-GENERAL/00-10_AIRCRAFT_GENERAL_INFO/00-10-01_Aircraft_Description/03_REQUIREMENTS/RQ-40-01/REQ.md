# RQ-40-01 â€” Certification Basis (EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25)

## Statement
The aircraft shall be certified under **EASA CS-25** (Large Aeroplanes) and **FAA Part 25** (Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes) as the primary certification basis, with Special Conditions and Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) findings as required for novel technologies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Type Certification Basis**  
   - **Regulatory framework:** EASA CS-25 Amendment 27 (or later) and FAA Part 25 Amendment 140 (or later) as applicable at program start.  
   - **Concurrent certification:** Pursue EASA and FAA Type Certificates simultaneously (harmonized certification approach where possible).  
   - **Certification schedule:** Type Certificate achieved within **[X] years** of program launch; Entry Into Service (EIS) within **[Y] years**.

2. **Special Conditions (Novel Technologies)**  
   - **Hydrogen propulsion:** Special Condition for hydrogen fuel system safety (cryogenic storage, fuel-cell operation, hydrogen venting) per **EASA SC-H2** framework.  
   - **Electric propulsion:** Special Condition for high-voltage electrical systems (HVDC distribution, isolation monitoring, motor-driven propulsors) per emerging standards.  
   - **Blended-wing-body:** Special Conditions for BWB airframe (structural certification, ditching, emergency evacuation) as required.  
   - **Autonomous systems:** If applicable, Special Conditions for advanced automation/autonomy features (EMS, flight controls).

3. **Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) Findings**  
   - **Novel design features:** Where compliance with existing regulations impractical (e.g., BWB cabin layout vs. tube-and-wing evacuation standards), demonstrate Equivalent Level of Safety via analysis, testing, or operational procedures.  
   - **ELOS documentation:** Comprehensive safety case for each ELOS finding, including hazard analysis, risk mitigation, and compensating measures.

4. **Compliance Verification**  
   - **Compliance matrix:** Detailed compliance matrix mapping each CS-25/Part 25 paragraph to verification method (analysis, test, inspection, demonstration, similarity).  
   - **Certification plan:** Type Certification Plan (TCP) defining certification strategy, milestones, deliverables, and authority engagement.  
   - **Authority coordination:** Regular engagement with EASA and FAA (Issue Papers, certification meetings, test witnessing) throughout development.

5. **Regulatory Acceptance**  
   - **Type Certificate issuance:** EASA and FAA Type Certificates issued confirming compliance with certification basis.  
   - **Production certification:** Production Organization Approval (POA) / Production Certificate (PC) for manufacturing.  
   - **Operational approval:** Aircraft eligible for commercial air transport operations under applicable operating regulations (EASA Part-CAT, FAA Part 121/135).

## Rationale
CS-25 and Part 25 are established certification standards for transport category aircraft, ensuring airworthiness and safety. Novel technologies (Hâ‚‚, electric propulsion, BWB) require Special Conditions and ELOS findings to adapt regulations to innovative design, while maintaining equivalent safety levels.
