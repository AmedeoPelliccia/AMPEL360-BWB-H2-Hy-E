## Acceptance Criteria
1. **SC-H2 Compliance**  
   - **Special Condition scope:** LHâ‚‚ storage, distribution, fuel-cell integration, venting, fire protection, crash safety, ground handling.  
   - **Safety assessment:** Comprehensive safety case per **ARP4761** addressing hydrogen-specific hazards (cryogenic exposure, embrittlement, flammability, asphyxiation).  
   - **Material compatibility:** All materials in contact with LHâ‚‚ qualified for cryogenic and hydrogen service (no embrittlement, permeation limits met).

2. **SAE ARP8677 Standards**  
   - **Installation practices:** Hydrogen system installation per **SAE ARP8677** (piping, fittings, seals, sensors, grounding, bonding).  
   - **Leak detection:** Hydrogen leak detection system per ARP8677 (sensor placement, alarm thresholds, response procedures).  
   - **Maintenance procedures:** Hydrogen system maintenance per ARP8677 (purging, leak checking, component replacement, personnel training).

3. **Hydrogen Safety Standards**  
   - **ISO 19880-1:** Fueling station interface and safety interlocks (per **RQ-20-02**).  
   - **ISO 14687:** Hydrogen fuel quality (purity, contaminants).  
   - **NFPA 2:** Hydrogen Technologies Code (fire safety, venting, exclusion zones).  
   - **EN 1473:** LNG/LHâ‚‚ installation safety (cryogenic system design).

4. **System-Level Requirements**  
   - **Crash safety:** Hydrogen tanks and piping protected per crashworthiness requirements (survivable accident envelope).  
   - **Fire protection:** Hydrogen fire detection and suppression per **RQ-20-06** and **ATA 26**.  
   - **Venting safety:** Hydrogen venting to atmosphere per safe dispersion criteria (no accumulation in confined spaces).  
   - **Ground operations:** Hydrogen ground handling procedures and equipment per **ISO 19880-1** and airport safety requirements.

5. **Certification and Approval**  
   - **Authority acceptance:** EASA and FAA accept hydrogen system design via Special Condition compliance demonstration.  
   - **Test validation:** Hydrogen system safety validated via ground tests (leak, fire, crash, fueling), component tests, and analysis.
