# RQ-30-05 â€” Safety Traceability (Req â†’ Hazard â†’ Test Linkage)

## Statement
Complete bidirectional traceability shall be maintained between **requirements**, **hazards**, and **verification tests** throughout the development lifecycle per **ARP4754A** trace tree methodology, ensuring regulatory compliance and safety case completeness.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Requirements Traceability**  
   - **Forward traceability:** Every requirement (aircraft, system, component level) traces forward to verification method (analysis, test, inspection, demonstration).  
   - **Backward traceability:** Every verification artifact traces back to parent requirement(s).  
   - **Coverage:** â‰¥ **100% traceability** for safety-critical requirements (DAL A/B per DO-178C/DO-254).

2. **Hazard Linkage**  
   - **FHA/PSSA/SSA integration:** Hazards identified in Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA), Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA), and System Safety Assessment (SSA) linked to related requirements.  
   - **Safety requirements derivation:** Safety requirements (failure conditions, probability targets, detection/mitigation) derived from hazard analysis and traceable to verification.  
   - **FMEA/FTA integration:** Failure modes (FMEA) and fault trees (FTA) linked to requirements and hazards.

3. **Test Linkage**  
   - **Test case traceability:** Every test case (unit, integration, system, flight test) traceable to requirements and hazards addressed.  
   - **Test coverage metrics:** Automated coverage analysis shows **100% requirement coverage** by verification activities.  
   - **Regression testing:** Traceability enables automated regression test selection when requirements change (test only affected areas).

4. **Tool Support and Automation**  
   - **Requirements management tool:** DOORS, Polarion, or equivalent tool captures traceability links.  
   - **Automated trace matrix generation:** Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) and Hazard Traceability Matrix (HTM) auto-generated from tool database.  
   - **Real-time compliance monitoring:** Dashboard displays traceability gaps, orphaned requirements, untested hazards.

5. **Regulatory Audit Readiness**  
   - **Certification evidence:** Traceability matrices and supporting evidence (test reports, analysis results) package for regulatory submission.  
   - **Continuous compliance:** Traceability maintained throughout in-service phase (service bulletins, modifications trace back to safety assessment updates).

## Rationale
Regulatory safety case requires demonstrating that all hazards are identified, mitigated, and verified. Traceability provides evidence chain from requirements through safety analysis to verification, essential for **ARP4754A** and **ARP4761** compliance and certification approval.

## Notes
- **Best practice:** Traceability is foundational to systems engineering and safety management; requirement applies across all domains (not just safety-critical).  
- **Tool investment:** Modern requirements management tools (DOORS Next, Jama, Polarion) provide robust traceability features; initial setup effort pays dividends throughout lifecycle.
