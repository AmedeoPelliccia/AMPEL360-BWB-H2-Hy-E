## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Development Assurance Level (DAL) Assignment**  
   - **Level A (catastrophic):** Flight control laws, EMS critical functions, fuel-cell control, HALT logic, isolation monitoring.  
   - **Level B (hazardous):** Navigation, autoflight, engine indication, battery management.  
   - **Level C/D (major/minor):** Cabin systems, passenger information, non-critical monitoring.  
   - **DAL determination:** Per **ARP4754A** safety assessment (FHA/PSSA/SSA) and **ARP4761** hazard analysis.

2. **DO-178C Process Compliance**  
   - **Planning:** Software Planning Process, Software Development Plan (SDP), Software Verification Plan (SVP), Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP), Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP).  
   - **Development:** Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Code implementation with full traceability per **RQ-30-05**.  
   - **Verification:** Reviews, analysis, testing per SVP; structural coverage analysis (MC/DC for Level A).  
   - **Configuration management:** Version control, change control, problem reporting per SCMP.  
   - **Quality assurance:** Independent QA audits per SQAP; SOI (Software Overview of Compliance) produced.

3. **Level A Verification Objectives**  
   - **Requirements-based testing:** All high-level and low-level requirements verified by test cases.  
   - **Structural coverage (MC/DC):** Modified Condition/Decision Coverage achieved for all Level A code.  
   - **Code reviews:** Source code reviewed against coding standards and low-level requirements.  
   - **Traceability:** Bidirectional traceability from requirements â†’ design â†’ code â†’ tests.

4. **Tool Qualification**  
   - **Development tools:** Compilers, linkers, code generators qualified per **DO-178C Tool Qualification** (or tool output verified).  
   - **Verification tools:** Test harnesses, coverage analyzers, static analysis tools qualified as applicable.

5. **Certification Data Package**  
   - **Software Accomplishment Summary (SAS):** Summary of DO-178C compliance for certification authorities.  
   - **Software Configuration Index (SCI):** Inventory of all software deliverables (executables, source, documentation).  
   - **Certification liaison:** SOI and compliance evidence reviewed and accepted by EASA/FAA.

## Scope & Allocation
- **Level A software:**  
  - **L1-22/27** Flight Control Laws, EMS (fuel-cell, battery, propulsor power management)  
  - **E1-26** HALT logic (autonomous fire suppression)  
  - **E2-24** Isolation monitoring, HVDC protection logic

## Notes
- **DO-178C vs. DO-178B:** DO-178C incorporates model-based development, object-oriented programming, and formal methods (supplements DO-331, DO-332, DO-333).
