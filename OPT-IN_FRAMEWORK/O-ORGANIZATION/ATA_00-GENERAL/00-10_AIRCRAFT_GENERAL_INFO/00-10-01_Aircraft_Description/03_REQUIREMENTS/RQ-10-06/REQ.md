3. **Fuel-Cell Protection and Longevity**  
   - Fuel-cell power rate-of-change limited to **â‰¤ 5% per second** via battery buffering.  
   - Battery absorbs **100%** of transient demands > **5% per second** to extend fuel-cell membrane life.

## Rationale
Buffering transient power demands via the COâ‚‚ battery decouples the fuel-cell system from rapid load changes, extending fuel-cell lifetime and improving efficiency by keeping the fuel cells operating in their optimal efficiency band. The battery's fast response time (< 100 ms) complements the slower fuel-cell dynamics (seconds), enabling a synergistic hybrid architecture. Regenerative energy capture during descent further improves mission energy efficiency.

## Constraints & Interfaces
- **Battery capacity constraint:** Total usable energy (â‰¥ 500 kWh per **RQ-10-02**) must support Â±20% buffering for expected transient durations without depleting SOC below 20% or exceeding 80%.  
- **Thermal management:** Battery charge/discharge at Â±2â€“3 MW generates **â‰ˆ 200â€“300 kW** waste heat; thermal system must reject this without exceeding battery operating temperature (â‰¤ 45Â°C).  
- **EMS algorithm complexity:** Predictive load management requires real-time flight phase monitoring, weather data (wind/turbulence), and thrust demand forecasting.  
- **Certification of predictive algorithms:** EMS software classified as **DO-178C Level A** (critical to flight safety via power management).

## Assumptions
- **Mission profile transients:** Typical regional mission includes **5â€“10 major transient events** (takeoff, climb, cruise level changes, descent, go-around decision).  
- **Fuel-cell response time:** Fuel-cell power output can change at **â‰¤ 5% per second**; faster demands must be buffered by battery.  
- **Battery degradation:** Battery capacity degrades by **< 10%** over **5,000 equivalent full cycles** (design life), ensuring buffering capability maintained throughout aircraft operational life.  
- **Regenerative opportunity:** Typical descent provides **â‰ˆ 50â€“100 kWh** recoverable energy (depends on altitude and descent rate).
