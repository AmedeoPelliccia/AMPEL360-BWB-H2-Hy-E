   - Fuel type: **100% SAF** (ASTM D7566 approved blends) or **Jet-A/Jet-A1** fallback.  
   - Fuel tank capacity: **â‰¥ 4,000 liters** (â‰ˆ3,200 kg of SAF).  
   - Fuel system compliant with **CS-25.951** through **CS-25.979** (fuel system design).  
   - Fuel pumps, valves, and distribution per **ATA 28-40**.

2. **Turbogenerator Integration**  
   - SAF-burning auxiliary power unit (APU) or turbogenerator rated for **â‰¥ 2 MW electrical output**.

   - Fuel system monitoring and alerts per **ATA 28-60**.

5. **Compatibility and Storage**  
   - SAF storage tanks constructed from **aluminum alloy or composite** compatible with SAF chemistry.

## Rationale
The SAF interface provides operational flexibility, regulatory compliance for contingency power, and backward compatibility with existing airport fuel infrastructure. This hybrid approach de-risks hydrogen adoption during the transition period while maintaining zero-emission capability as the primary operational mode.

## Constraints & Interfaces
- **Weight allocation:** SAF system (tanks + turbogenerator) â‰¤ **1,800 kg empty** + **3,200 kg fuel** when full.  
- **Fire safety:** SAF tanks and turbogenerator must comply with **CS-25.863** (fire zones), **ATA 26** (fire detection and suppression).  
- **Emissions trade-off:** SAF operation produces COâ‚‚ emissions; however, lifecycle COâ‚‚ from SAF is **â‰¤ 80% lower** than fossil Jet-A (per ASTM D7566 sustainability criteria).  
- **Operational complexity:** Flight crew training required for dual-fuel operations and fuel mode management.  
- **Infrastructure dependency:** SAF availability varies by airport; operational planning must account for SAF supply chain.

## Assumptions

- Turbogenerator technology: **commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)** APU or small gas turbine adapted for electrical generation.  
- Fuel system design leverages existing **Jet-A** certification basis with **SAF compatibility validation** per ASTM D7566.  
- Regulatory acceptance: **CS-25 and FAA Part 25** allow hybrid Hâ‚‚/SAF architecture with appropriate safety case.

## Notes
- **Operational priority:** The aircraft is designed for **hydrogen-primary** operations. SAF mode is **secondary/contingency only** to maximize zero-emission flight time.  
- **Emissions accounting:** When operating in SAF mode, COâ‚‚ emissions are calculated and reported per CORSIA requirements, but lifecycle emissions are significantly reduced due to SAF sustainability criteria.  
- **Future evolution:** As hydrogen infrastructure matures globally, SAF system usage is expected to decline, and future variants may eliminate SAF capability to reduce weight and complexity.
