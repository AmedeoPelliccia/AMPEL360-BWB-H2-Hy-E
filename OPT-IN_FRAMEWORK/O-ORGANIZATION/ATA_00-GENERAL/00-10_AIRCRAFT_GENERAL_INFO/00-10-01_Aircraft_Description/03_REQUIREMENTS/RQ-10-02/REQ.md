## Rationale
The closed-loop COâ‚‚ battery decouples transient power demands from the fuel-cell system, which has slower response dynamics. This reduces fuel-cell oversizing, extends stack lifetime, and enables regenerative energy capture during descent and braking. The COâ‚‚ working fluid provides high energy density while avoiding lithium-ion fire risks and supply chain constraints.
