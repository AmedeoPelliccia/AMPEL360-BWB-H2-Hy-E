## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Refueling System Design and Standards Compliance**  
   - LHâ‚‚ refueling interface compliant with **ISO 19880-1** (fueling protocols, connector standards, safety interlocks).  
   - Cryogenic handling per **ISO 21013** (cryogenic vessels) and **EN 1473** (LNG/LHâ‚‚ installations).  
   - Refueling connector: **standardized LHâ‚‚ coupling** (SAE or ISO emerging standard) with automatic shutoff and leak detection.  
   - Grounding and bonding per **NFPA 2** (Hydrogen Technologies Code) to prevent static discharge ignition.

2. **Safety Interlocks and Automated Protection**  
   - **Pre-refueling checks:** Automated verification of aircraft electrical systems OFF, no ignition sources, tank pressure within limits.  
   - **Flow control:** Refueling rate limited to **â‰¤ 500 kg/h** to manage boil-off and thermal stress.  
   - **Emergency shutoff:** Automatic refueling termination within **â‰¤ 2 seconds** upon leak detection, overpressure, or manual emergency stop.  
   - **Leak detection:** Hydrogen sensors (â‰¤ 25% LEL) at refueling interface and tank vents with audible/visual alarms per **NFPA 2**.  
   - **Pressure relief:** Tank pressure relief valves set to **< 110%** of maximum working pressure (MAWP).

3. **Cryogenic Safety**  
   - **Personnel protection:** Refueling procedures require cryogenic-rated PPE (gloves, face shields, insulated clothing).  
   - **Cold burn prevention:** Transfer lines and couplings insulated to prevent accidental contact with -253Â°C surfaces.  
   - **Venting control:** Boil-off during refueling safely vented to atmosphere via elevated discharge per **ISO 19880-1** (â‰¥ 5 m above ground, â‰¥ 3 m from structures).  
   - **Spill containment:** Refueling area designed for rapid LHâ‚‚ evaporation; no pooling in low-lying areas (hydrogen buoyancy ensures rapid dispersion).

4. **Fire and Explosion Prevention**  
   - **Exclusion zones:** No ignition sources within **â‰¥ 10 m** of refueling interface during operations per **NFPA 2**.  
   - **Ventilation:** Refueling conducted in **open-air or well-ventilated** areas to prevent hydrogen accumulation (LEL = 4% in air).  
   - **Fire suppression:** Portable water spray systems available for cooling (Hâ‚‚ fires: non-luminous, extinguish by fuel isolation, not by direct suppression).  
   - **Lightning protection:** Aircraft and refueling equipment bonded and grounded per **SAE ARP5416** (lightning protection).

5. **Operational Procedures and Training**  
   - **Ground crew certification:** Refueling personnel trained and certified in LHâ‚‚ handling per **ISO 19880-1** and company safety protocols.  
   - **Refueling checklists:** Standardized procedures per **ATA 12** (Servicing) with safety verification steps.  
   - **Emergency response:** Refueling locations equipped with Hâ‚‚ fire/leak emergency plans, including evacuation procedures and firefighting resources.

## Constraints & Interfaces
- **Refueling time:** Target refueling time **â‰¤ 30 minutes** for full LHâ‚‚ load (â‰ˆ4,000 kg) to match operational turnaround requirements.  
- **Infrastructure dependency:** LHâ‚‚ refueling infrastructure availability varies by airport; operational planning must account for Hâ‚‚ network coverage.  
- **Regulatory approval:** Airport authorities and fire marshals must approve Hâ‚‚ refueling operations per local regulations and **ICAO Annex 14** (Aerodromes).  
- **Environmental conditions:** Refueling operations restricted during **thunderstorms** or when **wind speed > 15 m/s** (dispersion concerns).
