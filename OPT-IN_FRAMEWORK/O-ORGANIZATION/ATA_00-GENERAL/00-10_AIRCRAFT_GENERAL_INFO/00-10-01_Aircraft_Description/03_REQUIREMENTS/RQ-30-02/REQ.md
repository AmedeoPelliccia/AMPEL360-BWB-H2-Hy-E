## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Digital Product Passport (DPP) Implementation**  
   - **Complete lifecycle tracking:** Every aircraft component (part number, serial number, manufacturing data, installation date) recorded in DPP from manufacture through disposal.  
   - **Real-time synchronization:** DPP updates automatically upon component installation, removal, or modification (manual entry eliminated).  
   - **QR code/RFID integration:** Components tagged with machine-readable identifiers linked to DPP database.  
   - **Supplier integration:** Supply chain partners contribute data directly to DPP (material certifications, quality records, delivery documentation).

2. **Blockchain-Based Change Tracking**  
   - **Immutable audit trail:** All configuration changes (component swaps, software updates, modifications) recorded in blockchain ledger (tamper-evident, timestamped).  
   - **Smart contract automation:** Pre-approved configuration changes automatically validated and recorded via smart contracts (reduces manual approval workflow).  
   - **Multi-party consensus:** Engineering, quality, operations, and regulators participate in blockchain network (distributed trust model).  
   - **Regulatory audit readiness:** Configuration history instantly available to certification authorities with cryptographic proof of authenticity.

3. **Configuration Status Accounting**  
   - **Real-time aircraft configuration:** Current installed configuration (all components, software versions, modifications) visible in real-time to maintenance, operations, and engineering.  
   - **Configuration baseline management:** Aircraft baseline configuration (as-designed vs. as-built vs. as-maintained) tracked with automatic variance detection.  
   - **Change impact analysis:** Automated analysis of proposed configuration changes (airworthiness directives, service bulletins, engineering changes) against installed configuration.  
   - **Fleet consistency monitoring:** Fleet-wide configuration analytics identify configuration drift and standardization opportunities.

4. **Integration with Aircraft Systems**  
   - **Automated data capture:** Aircraft systems (e.g., EMS, FMS, maintenance computers) automatically report configuration data to DPP (software versions, calibration dates, component health).  
   - **Pre-flight configuration checks:** Automated configuration verification during pre-flight (detect incorrect installations, missing updates, expired calibrations).  
   - **Digital twin sync:** DPP configuration data synchronized with digital twin per **RQ-30-01** (ensuring twin matches physical aircraft).

5. **Security and Compliance**  
   - **Cybersecurity:** DPP and blockchain platform secured per **DO-326A**, **ISO/IEC 27001**.  
   - **Data privacy:** Sensitive configuration data (e.g., proprietary designs, security-critical systems) access-controlled per regulatory and OEM requirements.  
   - **Regulatory acceptance:** DPP and blockchain approach accepted by EASA/FAA as valid configuration management method (demonstration via special conditions or operational authorizations).

## Rationale
Traditional paper-based or spreadsheet configuration management is error-prone, labor-intensive, and difficult to audit. DPP + blockchain automation reduces human error, accelerates configuration changes, and provides real-time visibility to all stakeholders. Blockchain ensures tamper-evident audit trail meeting regulatory traceability requirements.

## Constraints & Interfaces
- **Interoperability:** DPP and blockchain must integrate with legacy maintenance systems (TRAX, AMOS, SAP) and OEM configuration management tools.  
- **Supplier participation:** Supply chain partners must adopt DPP data contribution (requires industry collaboration and standardization).  
- **Regulatory precedent:** DPP + blockchain for configuration management is novel; demonstration of compliance with existing regulations (**Part 21**, **Part 145**) required.  
- **Cost:** Blockchain infrastructure and DPP platform operation add cost; ROI from reduced manual labor and improved reliability must justify investment.

## Assumptions
- **Industry standards:** Emerging standards (e.g., IATA ONE Record, EASA DPP initiatives) provide framework for aviation DPP implementation.  
- **Blockchain technology:** Permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) suitable for aviation use case (vs. public blockchain).  
- **Regulatory acceptance:** Regulators increasingly open to digital/blockchain solutions for configuration management (precedents in pharmaceutical, automotive industries).  
- **Retrofit capability:** DPP/blockchain initially deployed for new-build aircraft; retrofit to in-service fleet feasible but requires significant data migration effort.
