## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Zero Carbon Emissions Verification**  
   - **In-flight emissions:** 0 g COâ‚‚/km validated via fuel composition analysis and stoichiometric calculation.  
   - **Primary energy source:** LHâ‚‚ combustion produces only Hâ‚‚O (water vapor); no carbon-containing byproducts.  
   - **COâ‚‚ battery loop:** Closed-loop COâ‚‚ system does not vent COâ‚‚ to atmosphere during normal operations per **RQ-10-02**.  
   - **SAF turbogenerator status:** **OFF** during zero-emission flight segments (Hâ‚‚-only mode).

2. **Operational Mode Definition**  
   - **Mode 1 (Zero-emission/Hâ‚‚-primary):** Fuel-cell stacks provide **100%** of propulsive and non-propulsive power; SAF turbogenerator OFF or standby; **0 g COâ‚‚/km**.  
   - **Mode 2 (Hybrid):** SAF turbogenerator supplements power during high-demand or contingency; COâ‚‚ emissions calculated per ICAO CORSIA methodology; **not zero-emission mode**.  
   - **Mission profile:** Aircraft designed for **â‰¥ 90%** of flight time in **Mode 1 (zero-emission)** for design range missions.

3. **Emissions Monitoring and Reporting**  
   - Onboard data logging captures fuel source selection (Hâ‚‚ vs. SAF) and power output per **ATA 31** (Indicating/Recording Systems).  
   - Post-flight emissions reporting per **ICAO Annex 16 Vol III** (COâ‚‚ certification) and **CORSIA** (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme).  
   - Digital Product Passport (**N-95**) tracks cumulative zero-emission flight hours and COâ‚‚ avoidance.

4. **Water Vapor Management**  
   - Hâ‚‚ fuel-cell byproduct: **pure water vapor** (Hâ‚‚O), no carbon content.  
   - Water management per **ATA 38** (Water/Waste): condensate collection or controlled overboard venting.  
   - No environmental impact from water vapor emissions (naturally occurring atmospheric component).

## Rationale
Achieving zero in-flight COâ‚‚ emissions addresses aviation's climate impact, aligning with ICAO's Carbon Neutral Growth (CNG) goals and supporting regional/national net-zero aviation commitments. Hydrogen fuel cells produce only water vapor, eliminating carbon emissions at the source without reliance on offsetting mechanisms.

## Scope & Allocation
- **Primary domains:**  
  - **C2-28** Fuel Systems (Hâ‚‚ as zero-carbon fuel per **RQ-10-01**)  
  - **E2-24** Electrical Power (fuel-cell power generation)  
  - **N-95** Digital Product Passport (emissions tracking, lifecycle accounting)  
  - **L1-22** EMS (operational mode management, fuel source selection)

- **Key interfaces:**  
  - Fuel-cell system â†’ Zero COâ‚‚ emissions certification  
  - EMS â†’ Operational mode logging (Hâ‚‚-only vs. hybrid)  
  - Digital twin â†’ Emissions reporting and traceability

## Constraints & Interfaces
- **Operational constraint:** Zero-emission mode limited to hydrogen-primary operations; SAF mode produces **â‰ˆ 80 g COâ‚‚/km** (SAF lifecycle emissions lower than fossil jet fuel but non-zero).  
- **Regulatory landscape:** ICAO/EASA/FAA emissions certification frameworks evolving to include hydrogen propulsion; aircraft must comply with emerging **Hâ‚‚ aircraft emissions standards**.  
- **Lifecycle emissions:** While in-flight COâ‚‚ = 0 g/km, upstream Hâ‚‚ production emissions depend on source ("green" electrolysis vs. "grey" steam methane reforming); operational sustainability requires **green Hâ‚‚ supply chain**.  
- **Verification complexity:** Emissions = 0 g/km is self-evident from Hâ‚‚ stoichiometry, but operational mode compliance (Hâ‚‚-only vs. hybrid) requires robust data logging and auditing.

## Assumptions
- **Hydrogen purity:** LHâ‚‚ supply meets **ISO 14687** (â‰¥ 99.97% purity); trace carbon impurities negligible.  
- **COâ‚‚ battery loop:** Closed-loop COâ‚‚ system remains sealed during normal operations (no unintended COâ‚‚ venting).  
- **Operational discipline:** Flight crews adhere to zero-emission mode protocol (Hâ‚‚-only) for mission segments where infrastructure and reserves permit.  
- **Regulatory acceptance:** ICAO and regional authorities recognize Hâ‚‚ fuel-cell propulsion as **zero-emission technology** for certification and reporting purposes.

## Notes
- **Lifecycle perspective:** While in-flight COâ‚‚ = 0 g/km, true net-zero aviation requires green hydrogen production (renewable energy electrolysis). Operational sustainability depends on Hâ‚‚ supply chain decarbonization.  
- **Contrail impact:** Hâ‚‚ combustion increases water vapor emissions, potentially affecting contrail formation and radiative forcing. Ongoing research assesses net climate impact (COâ‚‚ elimination vs. Hâ‚‚O contrail effects).  
- **Regulatory evolution:** ICAO is developing Hâ‚‚ aircraft emissions standards; aircraft design anticipates compliance with emerging regulations.
