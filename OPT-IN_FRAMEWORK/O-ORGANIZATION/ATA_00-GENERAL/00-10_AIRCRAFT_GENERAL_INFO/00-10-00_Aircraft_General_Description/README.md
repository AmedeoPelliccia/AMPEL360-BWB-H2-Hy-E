# 00-10-00 Aircraft Description — Overview

## Purpose  
Provide a high-level description of the AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E aircraft concept to define its configuration, propulsion architecture, and system integration philosophy within the OPT-IN framework.

## General Description  
The **AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E** is a **Hybrid-Electric Blended-Wing-Body (BWB)** aircraft architecture designed for **zero-emission medium-range operations**.  
Its structure integrates propulsion, energy storage, and cabin volume into a unified aerodynamic lifting body, minimizing induced drag and improving volumetric efficiency.

### Core Configuration  
- **Airframe:** Composite blended-wing-body, pressurized central cabin, distributed load-bearing structure.  
- **Propulsion:** Hybrid system combining **H₂ PEM fuel-cells** with **open-fan electric propulsors** and a **closed-loop CO₂ battery** for transient power demand.  
- **Energy Systems:**  
  - Cryogenic hydrogen storage and distribution at ~20 K.  
  - CO₂ electrochemical storage loop for reversible oxidation–reduction buffering.  
  - SAF-compatible fuel interface for transitional hybrid operation.  
- **Flight Controls:** Electrically actuated control surfaces with redundant fly-by-wire logic and adaptive aerodynamic trim.  
- **Electrical Power:** DC high-voltage bus with modular converters, fuel-cell DC/DC regulation, and propulsion inverter clusters.  
- **Environmental Systems:** Electrified ECS, vapor-cycle thermal control for cryogenic and battery modules.  
- **Digital Backbone:** Full MBSE representation, DO-178C/254 compliant software stack, digital-twin synchronization, and EU Digital Product Passport for every serialized component.

### Operational Objectives  
- Achieve **zero in-flight CO₂ emissions** during hydrogen operation.  
- Enable **circular energy integration** through closed-loop carbon reuse.  
- Support **SAF-fueled hybrid missions** for range extension or certification flexibility.  
- Minimize maintenance via condition-based analytics and health-monitoring integration.  
- Serve as **demonstrator architecture** for scalable hybrid-electric BWB platforms.

### Certification & Compliance Context  
- Developed under **EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25** large transport category.  
- Hydrogen systems following **CS-H₂ (provisional)** and **SAE ARP 8677** guidance.  
- Software, hardware, and safety alignment with **DO-178C**, **DO-254**, **ARP4754A**, **ARP4761**, and **ISO 14001/50001** for sustainability management.  
- Maintenance and lifecycle integration per **MSG-3** and **S1000D Issue 6**.

## Status  
Baseline configuration documented — awaiting performance envelope definition and mission architecture validation.
