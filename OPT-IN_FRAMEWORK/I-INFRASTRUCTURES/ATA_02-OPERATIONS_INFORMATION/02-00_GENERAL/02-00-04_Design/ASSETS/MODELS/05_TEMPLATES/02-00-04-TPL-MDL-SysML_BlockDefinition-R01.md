## 1. Purpose & Scope

Describe the purpose of this SysML Block Definition Diagram (BDD). What
system, subsystem, or component does it decompose? What is the intended
audience and usage?

**Example:**
> This BDD decomposes the Operations Center (OPSCTR) into its primary
> subsystems: control workstations, display systems, communication interfaces,
> and supporting infrastructure. It serves as the architectural reference for
> system integration and interface design.

## 2. Block Definitions

List and describe the main blocks (components/subsystems) defined in this
diagram.

### 2.1 [Block Name 1]
* **Description:** Brief description of this block
* **Type:** Hardware / Software / System
* **Properties:**
  * Property 1: [type, unit]
  * Property 2: [type, unit]
* **Operations:** List of key operations or functions
* **Constraints:** Any design or operational constraints

### 2.2 [Block Name 2]

## 3. Block Relationships

Describe the relationships between blocks (composition, aggregation,
generalization, associations).

### 3.1 Composition
* **Parent Block** contains **Child Block(s)**
* Example: OPSCTR_System contains Control_Workstation_Block

### 3.2 Associations
* **Block A** is associated with **Block B** via [interface/protocol]
* Example: Control_Workstation_Block is associated with Display_System_Block
  via HDMI/DisplayPort

    class OPSCTR_System {
        +String systemID
        +Location location
        +operate()
        +monitor()
    }
    class Control_Workstation {
        +int stationNumber
        +String operatorID
        +displayAlerts()
    }
    OPSCTR_System *-- Control_Workstation : contains
