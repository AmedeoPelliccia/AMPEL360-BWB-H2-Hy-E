# Model Naming Convention (ATA 02-00-04)

## Overview

All model files under `ASSETS/MODELS/` follow a standardized naming pattern
to ensure consistency, traceability, and easy identification of model type,
domain, subject, and revision.

---

## Naming Pattern

```text
[ATA]-MDL-[Domain]-[Subject]-[ModelType]-R[rev].[ext]
```

---

## Pattern Components

### [ATA]
**Value:** `02-00-04`

The ATA chapter and section identifier for Operations Information / Design.

### MDL
**Value:** `MDL` (fixed)

Indicates this is a **model** artifact (as opposed to DWG for drawings,
INST for installations, etc.).

### [Domain]
**Values:** `ARCH` | `BEH` | `PERF` | `SIM` | `DT`

Indicates the primary domain or category of the model:

* **ARCH** = Architecture (SysML, UML, system decomposition, etc.)
* **BEH** = Behaviour (state machines, activity diagrams, control logic)
* **PERF** = Performance (capacity, availability, reliability, response time)
* **SIM** = Simulation (discrete event, dynamic systems, scenario models)
* **DT** = Digital Twin (data contracts, tag maps, integration specifications)

### [Subject]
**Examples:** `OPSCTR`, `DATACENTER`, `H2ROOM`, `GSE_AREA`, `UPS`, `AlarmHandling`

The system, location, or functional area that the model describes. Use
descriptive but concise identifiers that match your project's nomenclature.

### [ModelType]
**Examples:** `SysML_Context`, `UML_Deployment`, `StateMachine-AlarmHandling`,
`Capacity-OperatorStations`, `UPS_Availability`, `DiscreteEvent-Scenarios`,
`DataContract`, `TagMap`

A short description of the specific model form or methodology. Use underscores
for spaces within multi-word types, and hyphens to separate sub-categories
if needed.

### R[rev]
**Format:** `R01`, `R02`, `R03`, ...

The revision number. Always use two digits with leading zero (e.g., `R01`).
Increment for each significant update or release of the model.

### [ext]
**Examples:** `.md`, `.xlsx`, `.ipynb`, `.mdl`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`

The file extension appropriate to the tool or format used for the model:

* **Markdown** (`.md`) for text-based models and documentation
* **Excel** (`.xlsx`) for spreadsheet-based performance models
* **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) for Python-based simulations
* **Simulink/Modelica** (`.mdl`, `.slx`, `.mo`) for dynamic system models
* **JSON/CSV** (`.json`, `.csv`) for data models and contracts
* **XML/XMI** (`.xml`, `.xmi`) for UML/SysML exports

## Examples

### Architecture Models

* `02-00-04-MDL-ARCH-OPSCTR-SysML_Context-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-ARCH-DATACENTER-SysML_Context-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-ARCH-OPSCTR-UML_Deployment-R01.md`

### Behaviour Models

* `02-00-04-MDL-BEH-OPSCTR-StateMachine-AlarmHandling-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-BEH-OPSCTR-Activity-ShiftChange-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-BEH-DATACENTER-ControlLogic-R01.md`

### Performance Models

* `02-00-04-MDL-PERF-OPSCTR-Capacity-OperatorStations-R01.xlsx`
* `02-00-04-MDL-PERF-DATACENTER-UPS_Availability-R01.xlsx`
* `02-00-04-MDL-PERF-OPSCTR-CallHandling-QueueModel-R01.ipynb`

### Simulation Models

* `02-00-04-MDL-SIM-OPSCTR-DiscreteEvent-Scenarios-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-SIM-DATACENTER-CoolingResponse-R01.mdl`
* `02-00-04-MDL-SIM-OPSCTR-ScenarioCatalogue-R01.md`

### Digital Twin Exchange

* `02-00-04-MDL-DT-OPSCTR-DataContract-R01.json`
* `02-00-04-MDL-DT-DATACENTER-TagMap-R01.csv`
* `02-00-04-MDL-DT-IntegrationGuide-R01.md`

## Sidecar Documentation

For binary or complex models (Simulink, Modelica, large spreadsheets, etc.),
create a **sidecar Markdown file** with the same base name:

**Model file:**
`02-00-04-MDL-SIM-DATACENTER-CoolingResponse-R01.mdl`

**Sidecar documentation:**
`02-00-04-MDL-SIM-DATACENTER-CoolingResponse-R01.md`

The sidecar `.md` file should describe:

* Purpose and scope of the model
* Key assumptions and limitations
* Inputs, outputs, and parameters
* Usage instructions
* Validation results or references

---

## Revision Management

When a model is updated:

1. Increment the revision number (e.g., `R01` → `R02`)
2. Update the `Modified_Date` in `02-00-04-MDL_Global_Index.csv`
3. Optionally move the old revision to `99_ARCHIVE/` with a dated subfolder
4. Document the change in `02-00-04-MDL_Change_Log.csv`

---

## Compliance

All models must:

* Follow this naming convention exactly
* Be registered in `02-00-04-MDL_Global_Index.csv`
* Include appropriate metadata (originator, checker, approver, status)
* Link to related BIM models, drawings, procedures, and requirements

---

## Document Control

* **Version:** 1.0
* **Status:** WORKING
* **Last Updated:** 2025-11-17
* **Notes:** This naming convention was generated by AI prompted by Amedeo Pelliccia
  and must be reviewed and approved before official use.
