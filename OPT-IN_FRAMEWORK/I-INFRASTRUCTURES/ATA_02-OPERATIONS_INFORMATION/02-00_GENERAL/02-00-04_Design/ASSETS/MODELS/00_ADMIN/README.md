# MODELS — Logical / Behavioural / Performance Models (ATA 02-00-04)

## 1. Purpose

This folder contains **non-geometric models** that describe and analyse the
behaviour of systems under **ATA 02-00-04_Design** (Operations Information
infrastructures), including:

- System and software **architecture** (SysML, UML, etc.)
- Operational **behaviour** (state machines, activities, logic models)
- **Performance** (capacity, response time, availability, reliability)
- **Simulation** models (discrete event, dynamic systems)
- **Digital twin** data models and integration contracts

These models complement:

- Physical geometry in `ASSETS/INSTALLATIONS/BIM_CAD_MODELS/`
- 2D drawings in `ASSETS/DRAWINGS/`
- Procedures and operations documentation in
  `ASSETS/INSTALLATIONS/PROCEDURES/`

## 3. Naming Convention

Models use the following naming pattern:

```text
[ATA]-MDL-[Domain]-[Subject]-[ModelType]-R[rev].[ext]
```

Where:

* **[ATA]** = `02-00-04`
* **[Domain]** = `ARCH` (architecture), `BEH` (behaviour),
  `PERF` (performance), `SIM` (simulation), `DT` (digital twin)
* **[Subject]** = system or location:

  * `OPSCTR`, `DATACENTER`, `H2ROOM`, `GSE_AREA`, `UPS`, `AlarmHandling`, etc.
* **[ModelType]** = short description of the model form:

  * `SysML_Context`, `UML_Deployment`, `StateMachine-AlarmHandling`,
    `Capacity-OperatorStations`, `UPS_Availability`,
    `DiscreteEvent-Scenarios`, `DataContract`, `TagMap`, etc.
* **R[rev]** = revision (`R01`, `R02`, ...)
* **[ext]** = file extension (`md`, `xlsx`, `ipynb`, `mdl`, `json`, etc.)

**Examples**

* `02-00-04-MDL-ARCH-OPSCTR-SysML_Context-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-BEH-OPSCTR-StateMachine-AlarmHandling-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-PERF-DATACENTER-UPS_Availability-R01.xlsx`
* `02-00-04-MDL-SIM-OPSCTR-DiscreteEvent-Scenarios-R01.md`
* `02-00-04-MDL-DT-DATACENTER-TagMap-R01.csv`

---

## 4. Global Index & Traceability

`02-00-04-MDL_Global_Index.csv` should track at least:

* `Model_ID`
* `File_Name`
* `Domain` (ARCH, BEH, PERF, SIM, DT)
* `Subject` (OPSCTR, DATACENTER, etc.)
* `ModelType`
* `Revision`
* `Tool` (SysML tool, spreadsheet, Simulink, etc.)
* `Path`
* `Related_BIM_Models` (link to `BIM_CAD_MODELS`)
* `Related_Documents` (procedures, drawings, requirements)
* `Related_Requirements`
* `Status` (`WORKING`, `FOR_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `ARCHIVED`)

---

## 5. Lifecycle & Usage

1. **Define** model type and scope:

   * Architecture, behaviour, performance, simulation, digital twin.
2. **Create** the model under the appropriate subfolder using the naming
   convention and, if applicable, a template from `05_TEMPLATES/`.
3. **Document** important binary models with a sidecar Markdown file
   (`<same_name>.md`) describing:

   * Purpose, assumptions, inputs/outputs, scenarios, limitations.
4. **Register** the model in `02-00-04-MDL_Global_Index.csv` and any local
   index (e.g. for performance or simulation models).
5. When superseded, move the old version into `99_ARCHIVE/` under a
   dated archive folder and update the index.

## 6. Document Control

* **Originator:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Checker:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Approver:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Status:** `WORKING` / `FOR_REVIEW` / `APPROVED` / `ARCHIVED`
* **Notes:**

  * This structure and README were **generated by AI prompted by Amedeo Pelliccia**.
  * Content must be **reviewed and approved by a designated human checker/approver**
    before being used as an official design baseline.
