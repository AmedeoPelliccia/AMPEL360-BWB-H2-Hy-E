# 40_INTERFACE_DRAWINGS — Interface and Coordination Drawings

## Purpose

This directory contains **interface drawings** showing coordination between disciplines and systems:

- MEP/IT interface points and connection requirements
- Building boundary interfaces (walls, floors, penetrations)
- Coordination between architectural, structural, and MEP systems
- Handover boundaries between contractors or work packages
- External interfaces to existing facilities or utilities

---

## Drawing Domain

All drawings in this directory use domain code: **INT** (Interface drawings)

---

## Typical Content

Interface drawings typically include:

- Overlay plans showing multiple disciplines on one sheet
- Interface point locations with connection specifications
- Coordination zones and responsibility boundaries
- Service routing and space allocation between disciplines
- Conflict resolution documentation
- Design assumptions at interface points
- Coordination meeting notes and agreed solutions
- Interface control documents (ICD) references

```text
02-00-04-DWG-INT-[Location]-[InterfaceType]-[SheetID]-R[rev].[ext]
```

**Examples:**

- `02-00-04-DWG-INT-OPSCTR-MEP_IT_Interfaces-SHT01-R01.dwg`
- `02-00-04-DWG-INT-DATACENTER-BuildingBoundary-SHT01-R01.dwg`

## Sidecar Descriptions

Each `.dwg` file should have a corresponding `.md` file with the same basename providing:

- Drawing identification and metadata
- Purpose and scope
- Source BIM models and references
- Content summary
- Interface responsibilities and boundaries
- Coordination meeting references
- Assumptions and constraints
- Revision history
- Approval information (often requires multi-party approval)

See `DRAWING_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md` in `00_ADMIN/` for the standard template.
