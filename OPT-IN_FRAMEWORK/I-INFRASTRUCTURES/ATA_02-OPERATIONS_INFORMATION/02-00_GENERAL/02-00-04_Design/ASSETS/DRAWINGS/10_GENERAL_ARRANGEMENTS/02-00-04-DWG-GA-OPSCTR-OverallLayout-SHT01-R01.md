## 2. Purpose & Scope

Brief description of **what this drawing shows** and **what it is used for**.

- **Purpose:**  
  Overall layout of the Operations Center (OPSCTR), including operator consoles,
  circulation paths, main equipment locations, and key clearances for maintenance
  and emergency egress.

- **Scope / Limits:**  
  Scope limited to room OPSCTR on Level 1. Vertical routing of MEP/IT systems
  and detailed equipment mounting details are not shown in this general arrangement.
  See related discipline drawings (MEP, IT) and detail drawings for complete information.

## 5. Assumptions & Constraints

- Room envelope dimensions as per ARCH model R01 (8.5m x 12.0m).
- Console layout based on operator headcount specification v1.3 (6 operators).
- Raised floor height 600mm for cable management (to be verified with MEP).
- Power and IT connection points shown schematically; see interface drawings for exact locations and specifications.
- Ceiling height 3.0m clear; HVAC and lighting details in MEP discipline model.
- Door swing directions comply with fire safety egress requirements.
