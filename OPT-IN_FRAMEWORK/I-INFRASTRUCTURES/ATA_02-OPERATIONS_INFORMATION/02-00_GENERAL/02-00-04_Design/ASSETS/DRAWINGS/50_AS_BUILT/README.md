# 50_AS_BUILT — As-Built Drawings

## Purpose

This directory contains **as-built drawings** documenting the final installed configuration:

- Verified field conditions after construction/installation
- As-installed equipment locations and orientations
- Final routing of cables, pipes, and ductwork
- Actual dimensions and clearances (vs. design intent)
- Field modifications and deviations from design drawings
- Final configuration for facility management and maintenance

---

## Drawing Domain

All drawings in this directory use domain code: **ASB** (As-built drawings)

---

## Typical Content

As-built drawings typically include:

- Red-line markups from design drawings showing changes
- Surveyed locations and dimensions of installed equipment
- Actual cable/pipe routing with identification tags
- Field-verified connection points and service locations
- Construction modifications approved during installation
- Photographs or scans of installed conditions (referenced)
- Sign-off by installation contractor and owner's representative
- Date of as-built survey and verification

---

## Revision Conventions

As-built drawings often use special revision conventions:

- **R00** is commonly used for final as-built revisions
- Design revisions (R01, R02, etc.) precede the as-built revision
- As-built updates should reference the original design drawing
- File naming example: `...-ASB-...-R00.dwg` for final as-built

---

## Naming Convention

```text
02-00-04-DWG-ASB-[Location]-[Description]-[SheetID]-R00.[ext]
```

**Examples:**

- `02-00-04-DWG-ASB-OPSCTR-OverallLayout-SHT01-R00.dwg`
- `02-00-04-DWG-ASB-DATACENTER-OverallLayout-SHT01-R00.dwg`
- `02-00-04-DWG-ASB-H2ROOM-AsInstalled-SHT01-R00.dwg`

---

## Sidecar Descriptions

Each `.dwg` file should have a corresponding `.md` file with the same basename providing:

- Drawing identification and metadata
- Purpose and scope
- Source design drawings being superseded
- Survey and verification methods
- Major deviations from design
- Field modification references
- Sign-off and approval information
- Revision history

See `DRAWING_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md` in `00_ADMIN/` for the standard template.

---

## As-Built Process

1. Obtain copies of design drawings (from `10_GENERAL_ARRANGEMENTS/`, etc.)
2. Field survey and red-line markup during/after installation
3. Transfer markups to CAD (or use as-built survey data)
4. Verify critical dimensions and connections
5. Obtain sign-off from contractor and owner
6. Issue as R00 (or appropriate as-built revision)
7. Superseded design drawings move to `99_ARCHIVE/`
