# 99_ARCHIVE — Archived and Superseded Drawings

## Purpose

This directory contains **archived and superseded drawings**:

- Obsolete drawing revisions replaced by newer versions
- Drawings superseded by as-built documentation
- Historical drawing versions for reference and traceability
- Drawings from cancelled or alternative design options

---

## Archive Organization

Archives should be organized by date and reason:

```text
99_ARCHIVE/
├── 02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-11-17_PreAsBuilt/
├── 02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-10-15_DesignOption2/
└── 02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-09-01_InitialDesign/
```

Each archive folder should contain:

- Archived drawing files
- Archive manifest (list of files and reason for archival)
- Reference to replacement drawings (if applicable)

---

## Archive Naming Convention

Archive folders use the pattern:

```text
02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[Tag]/
```

Where:

- **[YYYY-MM-DD]** = date of archival
- **[Tag]** = brief descriptor of archive reason or content

**Examples:**

- `02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-11-17_PreAsBuilt/` — Superseded by as-built drawings
- `02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-10-15_DesignOption2/` — Alternative design not selected
- `02-00-04-DWG-ARCHIVE_2025-09-01_InitialDesign/` — Early concept superseded

---

## Archival Process

1. Identify drawings to be archived (superseded, obsolete, cancelled)
2. Create dated archive folder with descriptive tag
3. Create archive manifest listing files and archival reason
4. Move drawings and their sidecar `.md` files to archive folder
5. Update `02-00-04-DWG_Index.csv` status to `ARCHIVED`
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in `00_ADMIN/` noting the archival

---

## Archive Manifest Template

```markdown
# Archive Manifest — [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Tag]
