# DRAWINGS — 2D Design Drawings (ATA 02-00-04)

## 1. Purpose

This directory stores **2D design drawings** (sheet-type deliverables)
for **ATA 02-00-04_Design** (Operations Information infrastructures),
including:

- General arrangements of operations centers, data centers and related spaces
- Equipment and GSE assemblies (e.g. power carts, racks, consoles)
- Sections, details and installation-specific construction information
- Interface drawings between disciplines and with external parties
- As-built drawings corresponding to the final installed configuration

These drawings are typically:

- Generated from BIM models in `BIM_CAD_MODELS/`
- Referenced by layouts, procedures and installation documents
- Issued as part of design / construction / as-built deliverables

```

## 3. Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for all drawing files:

```text
[ATA]-DWG-[Domain]-[Location/Subject]-[SheetID]-R[rev].[ext]
```

Where:

* **[ATA]** = `02-00-04`
* **DWG** = drawing artifact
* **[Domain]**:

  * `GA`  – General Arrangements
  * `EQP` – Equipment / GSE drawings
  * `DET` – Sections and details
  * `INT` – Interface drawings
  * `ASB` – As-built drawings
* **[Location/Subject]** = e.g. `OPSCTR`, `DATACENTER`, `GSE_PowerCart`,
  `ServerRack`, etc.
* **[SheetID]** = project sheet identifier (e.g. `SHT01`, `SHT02`)
* **R[rev]** = revision (`R01`, `R02`, ...; `R00` often used for final as-built)
* **[ext]** = `dwg`, `dxf`, `pdf` as applicable

**Examples**

* `02-00-04-DWG-GA-OPSCTR-OverallLayout-SHT01-R01.dwg`
* `02-00-04-DWG-EQP-GSE_PowerCart-GeneralAssembly-SHT01-R01.dwg`
* `02-00-04-DWG-DET-DATACENTER-RaisedFloorDetail-SHT01-R01.dwg`
* `02-00-04-DWG-INT-OPSCTR-MEP_IT_Interfaces-SHT01-R01.dwg`
* `02-00-04-DWG-ASB-OPSCTR-OverallLayout-SHT01-R00.dwg`

## 4. Drawing Index & Traceability

The file:

* `02-00-04-DWG_Index.csv`

tracks metadata for all drawings with suggested columns:

* `Drawing_ID`
* `File_Name`
* `Domain` (GA, EQP, DET, INT, ASB)
* `Location_Subject`
* `SheetID`
* `Revision`
* `Native_Tool`
* `Native_Path`
* `Issued_PDF_Path`
* `Source_BIM_Models` (refs to `BIM_CAD_MODELS`)
* `Related_Requirements`
* `Related_ATA_Chapters`
* `Status` (`WORKING`, `FOR_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `AS_BUILT`, `ARCHIVED`)

---

## 5. Lifecycle & Usage

1. Generate drawings from **approved BIM models** in
   `.../BIM_CAD_MODELS/10_MASTER_MODELS/` and `20_DISCIPLINE_MODELS/`.
2. Save native drawing files (`.dwg`, etc.) in the appropriate subfolder.
3. Export and store issued PDFs either:

   * alongside the native file, or
   * in a parallel `VIEW_ONLY/` or deliverables structure (project choice).
4. Keep `02-00-04-DWG_Index.csv` in sync with each new or revised drawing.
5. When drawings are superseded, move them to `99_ARCHIVE/` under a dated
   archive folder.

## 6. Document Control

* **Originator:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Checker:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Approver:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Status:** `WORKING` / `FOR_REVIEW` / `APPROVED` / `AS_BUILT`
* **Notes:**

  * This structure and README were **generated by AI prompted by Amedeo Pelliccia**.
  * Content must be **reviewed and approved by a designated human checker/approver**
    before being used as an official design baseline.
