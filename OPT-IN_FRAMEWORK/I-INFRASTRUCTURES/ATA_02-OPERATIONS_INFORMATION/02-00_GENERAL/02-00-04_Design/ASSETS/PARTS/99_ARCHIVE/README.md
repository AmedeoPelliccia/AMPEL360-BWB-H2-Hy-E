# PARTS Archive (99_ARCHIVE)

## Purpose

This directory contains **archived and obsolete parts** from the PARTS library. Parts are moved here when they are:

* **Superseded** by a newer version or replacement part
* **Obsolete** and no longer used in any active assemblies
* **Deprecated** due to design changes or requirements updates

---

## Archive Structure

Each archive event creates a dated folder containing the archived part(s):

```text
99_ARCHIVE/
└── 02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_YYYY-MM-DD_[Tag]/
    ├── README.md                          # Archive event documentation
    ├── [Archived part folder 1]/
    ├── [Archived part folder 2]/
    └── ...
```

### Archive Folder Naming

```text
02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[Tag]/
```

* **YYYY-MM-DD** = Date of archive event
* **[Tag]** = Brief description of archive reason

**Examples:**

* `02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_2025-11-17_Superseded-by-0002/`
* `02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_2025-12-01_Design-Change-Consolidation/`
* `02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_2026-01-15_Vendor-Discontinuation/`

---

## Archive Process

### 1. Before Archiving

* **Verify** the part is truly obsolete and not used in any active assemblies
* **Document** the reason for archiving
* **Update** the Global Index (`00_ADMIN/02-00-04-PRT_Global_Index.csv`) to mark part as `ARCHIVED`
* **Record** the archive event in Change Log (`00_ADMIN/02-00-04-PRT_Change_Log.csv`)
* **Identify** replacement part if applicable

### 2. Archive Procedure

1. Create a new archive folder: `02-00-04-PRT-ARCHIVE_YYYY-MM-DD_[Tag]/`
2. Create an `README.md` in the archive folder documenting:
   - Date of archive
   - Parts archived
   - Reason for archiving
   - Replacement parts (if applicable)
   - Person responsible
3. **Move** (not copy) the entire part folder from its category location to the archive folder
4. Update documentation:
   - Update Global Index with archive location and status
   - Add entry to Change Log
   - Update any affected assembly BoMs

### 3. After Archiving

* **Retain** archived parts for historical reference and traceability
* **Do not delete** archived parts unless explicitly approved
* **Maintain** archive folders indefinitely for configuration management

## Archive Reason

[Detailed explanation of why these parts were archived]

## Replacement Parts

| Archived Part | Replacement Part | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|

## Retrieval and Reference

### Accessing Archived Parts

* Archived parts remain accessible in their archive folders
* Use the Global Index to locate archived parts by Part ID
* Reference the archive `README.md` for context and replacement information

### Using Archived Part Information

* Archived part data may be needed for:
  - Legacy system support
  - Historical configuration management
  - Lessons learned and design reviews
  - Warranty and liability tracking
  - Regulatory compliance records

---

## Retention Policy

* **Minimum Retention:** Indefinite (configuration management requirement)
* **Review Period:** Archived parts may be reviewed every 5 years for potential purge
* **Purge Approval:** Requires formal approval from engineering management and configuration control
* **Backup:** Ensure archived parts are included in repository backups

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
* Archive parts promptly when they become obsolete
* Document thoroughly with clear reasoning
* Maintain archive folder organization
* Keep Global Index synchronized with archive status
* Verify no active usage before archiving

### DON'T:
* Delete parts instead of archiving
* Archive parts still in use
* Archive without documentation
* Create duplicate archives
* Modify archived parts (read-only)
