# PARTS — Physical Parts Library (ATA 02-00-04)

## 1. Purpose

This directory contains the **parts library** for
**ATA 02-00-04_Design** (Operations Information infrastructures), including:

- Custom designed mechanical parts (brackets, frames, housings, etc.)
- Electrical / electronic parts (panels, breakers, connectors, harnesses)
- IT / network parts (racks, chassis, modules, COTS components)
- GSE / infrastructure parts (power carts, supports, enclosures)
- Fasteners and standardised hardware

Each **part** has its own folder, with:

- 3D / native CAD geometry
- 2D detail drawings
- Datasheets / specs (for COTS)
- Local README or metadata

These parts are referenced by:

- BIM models in `ASSETS/INSTALLATIONS/BIM_CAD_MODELS/`
- Drawings in `ASSETS/DRAWINGS/`
- BoMs in requirements / design documentation

## 2. Structure

```text
PARTS/
├── 00_ADMIN/                   # Governance, global index, naming, change log
├── 05_TEMPLATES/               # Templates for part metadata and folders
├── 10_MECHANICAL_PARTS/        # Brackets, frames, panels, fabricated items
├── 20_ELECTRICAL_ELECTRONIC_PARTS/ # Breakers, panels, harnesses, connectors
├── 30_IT_AND_NETWORK_PARTS/    # Racks, servers, network modules, COTS IT
├── 40_GSE_AND_INFRA_PARTS/     # GSE / local infrastructure parts
├── 50_FASTENERS_AND_STANDARD_PARTS/ # Bolts, nuts, washers, standard hardware
└── 99_ARCHIVE/                 # Archived / superseded parts
```

Each part is stored in a dedicated folder such as:

```text
10_MECHANICAL_PARTS/
└── 02-00-04-PRT-MECH-0001_ConsoleSideBracket/
    ├── README.md
    ├── 3D/
    ├── 2D/
    └── DATASHEETS/
```

## 3. Naming Convention

Part folders:

```text
[ATA]-PRT-[Category]-[PartCode]_[ShortName]/
```

Files inside follow:

* 3D / native CAD:

  ```text
  [ATA]-PRT-[Category]-[PartCode]_[ShortName].[ext]
  ```

* 2D drawings:

  ```text
  [ATA]-DWG-DET-PRT-[Category]-[PartCode]-[ShortName]-SHTxx-Ryy.[ext]
  ```

* Datasheets and COTS docs:

  ```text
  [ATA]-PRT-[Category]-[PartCode]_[ShortName]-Datasheet-Ryy.pdf
  ```

**Examples**

* `02-00-04-PRT-MECH-0001_ConsoleSideBracket/`
* `02-00-04-PRT-MECH-0001_ConsoleSideBracket.step`
* `02-00-04-DWG-DET-PRT-MECH-0001-ConsoleSideBracket-SHT01-R01.dwg`
* `02-00-04-PRT-IT-0200_ServerChassis_2U-Datasheet-R01.pdf`

---

## 4. Global Index & Traceability

`02-00-04-PRT_Global_Index.csv` should track at least:

* `Part_ID` (02-00-04-PRT-XXXX-####)
* `PartCode`
* `Category` (MECH, ELEC, IT, GSE, STD)
* `ShortName`
* `Folder_Path`
* `Main_3D_File`
* `Main_2D_Drawing`
* `Datasheet_Path`
* `COTS_or_Custom` (COTS / CUSTOM)
* `Supplier` / `Manufacturer` (for COTS)
* `Related_BoMs`
* `Related_BIM_Models`
* `Related_Drawings`
* `Status` (`WORKING`, `FOR_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `OBSOLETE`, `ARCHIVED`)

---

## 5. Lifecycle & Usage

1. **Create** a new part by:

   * Assigning a `PartCode`.
   * Creating a folder `02-00-04-PRT-[Category]-[PartCode]_[ShortName]/`
     under the appropriate category.
2. **Store** geometry, drawings and datasheets within that folder.
3. **Register** the part in `02-00-04-PRT_Global_Index.csv` and,
   if needed, in project BoMs.
4. When a part becomes obsolete or is replaced:

   * Move the folder to `99_ARCHIVE/` under a dated archive event.
   * Update the global index.

## 6. Document Control

* **Originator:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Checker:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Approver:** *[Name / Role]*
* **Status:** `WORKING` / `FOR_REVIEW` / `APPROVED`
* **Notes:**

  * This structure and README were **generated by AI prompted by Amedeo Pelliccia**.
  * Content must be **reviewed and approved by a designated human checker/approver**
    before being used as an official design baseline.
