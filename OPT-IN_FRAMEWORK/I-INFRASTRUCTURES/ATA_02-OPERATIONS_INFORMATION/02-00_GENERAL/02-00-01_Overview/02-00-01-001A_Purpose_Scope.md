# Purpose & Scope

## Purpose
Establish the operational information baseline for the AMPEL360 program, ensuring consistent, certifiable, and traceable **operations content** across infrastructure-driven topics.

## Scope
- **In-scope:** turnaround rules, handling/servicing constraints, operating envelopes, airport/infrastructure interfaces, cross-references to system-specific operations content.
- **Out-of-scope:** detailed design, subsystem internal engineering (owned by their technical ATA chapters).

## Interfaces
- Links to buckets in this chapter (e.g., `02-10_Operations`) and to other ATA chapters (e.g., 03 Support/GSE, 10 Parking/Storage/RTS).
