# Document Structure & References

## Structure
- **General Layer (`02-00_GENERAL`)**: governance, safety, requirements, certification, EIS/versioning, services, subsystems/components index, ops standards & sustainability.
- **Root Buckets** (present at chapter root): `02-10_Operations`, `02-20_Subsystems`, `02-30_Circularity`, `02-40_Software`, `02-50_Structures`, `02-60_Storages`, `02-70_Propulsion`, `02-80_Energy`, `02-90_Tables_Schemas_Diagrams`.

## Authoritative References
- ATA **iSpec 2200** (content/numbering)
- **S1000D** (modular publishing)
- AMPEL360 **Documentation Standard v1.1**
- (Add program-specific references as needed)

## Conformance
- All files include **metadata front-matter** and follow **naming rules**.
- Cross-link to subordinate folders; do not duplicate lifecycle content inside buckets.
