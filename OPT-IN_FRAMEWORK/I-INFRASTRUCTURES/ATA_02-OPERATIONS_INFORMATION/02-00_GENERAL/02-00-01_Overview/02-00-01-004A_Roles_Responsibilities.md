# Roles & Responsibilities

This document defines the key roles involved in the creation, governance, and maintenance of ATA 02 operations information within AMPEL360, and clarifies their responsibilities and key outputs.

## 1. Role Overview

| Role                         | Responsibilities                                                        | Key Outputs                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ops Information Lead        | ATA 02 chapter governance, acceptance, cross-ATA alignment, change control | Chapter READMEs, governance rules, approvals, change records  |
| Airport/Infra Liaison       | Capture airport constraints, ground services integration, infra dependencies | Airport compatibility notes, turnaround & infra constraints   |
| Safety Engineer (Ops)       | Provide FHA/FTA/FMEA inputs, identify ops hazards, define mitigations   | Safety analyses, hazard logs, mitigation requirements         |
| Certification Focal         | Define ops-related MoC, track evidence, interface with authorities      | Compliance matrix entries, MoC/evidence records, liaison logs |
| Technical Publications      | Ensure consistency with ATA iSpec 2200 / S1000D and AMPEL360 standards | CSDB records, publication packages, release notes             |

## 2. Role Descriptions

### 2.1 Ops Information Lead

- Owns governance of the ATA 02 chapter within AMPEL360.  
- Ensures cross-ATA alignment of operations information and traceability to requirements.  
- Approves structural changes (folders, identifiers, major content reorganizations).  
- Chairs or participates in reviews affecting ATA 02 content.

**Key Decisions**

- Acceptance of new/updated operations documents under ATA 02.  
- Prioritization of changes and resolution of conflicts across buckets.

### 2.2 Airport/Infra Liaison

- Collects and maintains airport and ground infrastructure constraints relevant to operations.  
- Ensures integration of ground services, turnaround processes, and airport interfaces into ATA 02 content.  
- Interfaces with airport/infra stakeholders (internal and external).

**Key Decisions**

- Validation of airport compatibility assumptions used in ops scenarios.  
- Acceptance of turnaround and infra-related constraints.

### 2.3 Safety Engineer (Ops)

- Contributes FHA/FTA/FMEA input focused on operational hazards and scenarios.  
- Identifies risk controls and ensures they are reflected in operations information.  
- Collaborates with Ops Information Lead, Certification Focal, and engineering safety teams.

**Key Decisions**

- Acceptance of operational hazard assessments and mitigations.  
- Safety sign-off for critical operational procedures where required.

### 2.4 Certification Focal

- Defines and maintains ops-related Means of Compliance (MoC) and evidence mapping.  
- Tracks certification-relevant data for ATA 02 materials.  
- Interfaces with authorities or customer certification teams as required.

**Key Decisions**

- Acceptance of MoC for operations-related items.  
- Confirmation that evidence in ATA 02 is complete for certification needs.

### 2.5 Technical Publications

- Ensures that all ATA 02 documents comply with:
  - ATA iSpec 2200 numbering and structuring rules.  
  - S1000D modular publishing principles (where applied).  
  - AMPEL360 Documentation Standard (e.g. front-matter, naming).  
- Manages CSDB records and publication packaging for release.

**Key Decisions**

- Acceptance of documents into the controlled publications baseline.  
- Resolution of format/structure issues prior to release.

## 3. RACI Alignment (Optional, Program-Specific)

Programs may define RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrices that specialize the above roles. These should:

- Reference the roles defined in this document as the baseline.  
- Be maintained in a program-level governance document and cross-linked from ATA 02 General.
