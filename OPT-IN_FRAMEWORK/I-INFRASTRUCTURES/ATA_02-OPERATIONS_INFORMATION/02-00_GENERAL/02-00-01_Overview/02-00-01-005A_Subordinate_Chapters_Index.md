# Subordinate Chapters Index — ATA 02

This index provides a navigable overview of the subordinate lifecycle folders within `02-00_GENERAL` and the root cross-ATA buckets at the ATA 02 chapter root. It is intended as the canonical entry point for navigation and cross-linking.

## 1. Lifecycle Folders (within `02-00_GENERAL`)

The following folders represent lifecycle-oriented governance and reference content under `02-00_GENERAL`. Each folder may have its own local index or README.

- **02-00-02_Safety**  
  → `../02-00-02_Safety/`  
  Safety governance, safety principles, and cross-ATA safety references.

- **02-00-03_Requirements**  
  → `../02-00-03_Requirements/`  
  High-level operations-related requirements, traceability, and requirement views.

- **02-00-04_Design**  
  → `../02-00-04_Design/`  
  Design-level views and constraints that shape ATA 02 operations information.

- **02-00-05_Interfaces**  
  → `../02-00-05_Interfaces/`  
  Cross-ATA and external interface definitions referenced by ATA 02.

- **02-00-06_Engineering**  
  → `../02-00-06_Engineering/`  
  Engineering analyses, technical notes, and rationales influencing operations.

- **02-00-07_V_AND_V**  
  → `../02-00-07_V_AND_V/`  
  Verification & Validation strategies, test concepts, and coverage views.

- **02-00-08_Prototyping**  
  → `../02-00-08_Prototyping/`  
  Prototyping activities and findings relevant to operations concepts.

- **02-00-09_Production_Planning**  
  → `../02-00-09_Production_Planning/`  
  Production planning assumptions and constraints that affect operations.

- **02-00-10_Certification**  
  → `../02-00-10_Certification/`  
  Certification strategies, Means of Compliance (MoC) references, and evidence maps.

- **02-00-11_EIS_Versions_Tags**  
  → `../02-00-11_EIS_Versions_Tags/`  
  Entry-into-service policies, versioning schemes, and tagging conventions for ATA 02.

- **02-00-12_Services**  
  → `../02-00-12_Services/`  
  Service catalog, service-level definitions, and ownership mapping.

- **02-00-13_Subsystems_Components**  
  → `../02-00-13_Subsystems_Components/`  
  Index and classification of subsystems and components referenced by ATA 02.

- **02-00-14_Ops_Std_Sustain**  
  → `../02-00-14_Ops_Std_Sustain/`  
  Operations standards, KPI definitions, and sustainability principles.

> Note: These folders hold governance, indices, and cross-ATA references. Detailed lifecycle content for a specific system or feature belongs in the relevant root bucket (e.g. `02-10_Operations`, `02-40_Software`) and is only indexed here.

## 2. Root Buckets (ATA 02 Chapter Root)

The following root buckets are located at the ATA 02 chapter root and contain the detailed, implementation-level content. They are shared across lifecycle stages and may be referenced from multiple ATAs.

- **02-10_Operations**  
  → `../../02-10_Operations/`  
  Operational concepts, use cases, procedures, and operating constraints.

- **02-20_Subsystems**  
  → `../../02-20_Subsystems/`  
  Subsystem breakdown, behavior, and subsystem-level responsibilities.

- **02-30_Circularity**  
  → `../../02-30_Circularity/`  
  Circularity strategies, re-use, recycling, and end-of-life concepts.

- **02-40_Software**  
  → `../../02-40_Software/`  
  Software architecture, components, and software-oriented views of operations.

- **02-50_Structures**  
  → `../../02-50_Structures/`  
  Structural views and constraints relevant to operations (e.g. access, loads).

- **02-60_Storages**  
  → `../../02-60_Storages/`  
  Storage systems (energy, data, materials) and operational implications.

- **02-70_Propulsion**  
  → `../../02-70_Propulsion/`  
  Propulsion-related content and performance constraints affecting operations.

- **02-80_Energy**  
  → `../../02-80_Energy/`  
  Energy generation, distribution, and management models in operational use.

- **02-90_Tables_Schemas_Diagrams**  
  → `../../02-90_Tables_Schemas_Diagrams/`  
  Shared tables, data schemas, and canonical diagrams referenced across buckets.

## 3. Usage & Conventions

- Use this index as the **primary navigation aid** from `02-00_GENERAL` into lifecycle folders and root buckets.  
- When introducing new folders under `02-00_GENERAL` or new root buckets, update this index **in the same change set**.  
- Cross-links from governance documents (e.g. Structure, Roles & Responsibilities) should point to this index when referencing the overall ATA 02 layout.
