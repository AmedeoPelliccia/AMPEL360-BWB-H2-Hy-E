# FMEA Worksheets — ATA 02 (CSV-Based)

This folder contains **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)** assets for ATA 02 Operations Information.

> Transition note: FMEA work is now **CSV-based** for consistency, automation, and easier diffing. Excel workbooks are no longer the primary artefact; use them only as optional views if needed.

---

## 1. Files

### 1.1 Canonical FMEA CSV (parent)

- `../02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv`  
  This is the **single source of truth** for ATA 02 FMEA records.

Typical columns (may be extended per program):

```csv
RowID,Function/Item,Failure_Mode,NN/IT_Cause,Local_Effect,System_Effect,Ops_Effect,Detection_Method,Mitigation/Compensation,Severity,Probability,DAL,References
```

All detailed FMEA work must **eventually be reflected** in this CSV.

### 1.2 FMEA View Definitions

FMEA view definitions describe how to filter and interpret specific subsets of the canonical CSV for different lifecycle phases:

- **Training Phase View**  
  → `../../02-00-02-A002_FMEA_View_Training_Phase.md`  
  Defines filtering rules for training-related FMEA entries (tagged `#TrainingFMEA`)

- **Deployment Phase View** (planned)  
  → `../../02-00-02-A003_FMEA_View_Deployment_Phase.md`  
  Will define filtering rules for deployment-related FMEA entries (tagged `#DeploymentFMEA`)

### 1.3 Optional FMEA Workbooks (views only)

If spreadsheets are still useful as working views, they should be treated as **generated/editorial views** of the CSV, not as primary records.

Recommended naming:

- `02-00-02-A001_FMEA_View_Ops_Pipeline.xlsx` (optional)
- `02-00-02-A002_FMEA_View_Training_Phase.xlsx` (optional)
- `02-00-02-A003_FMEA_View_Deployment_Phase.xlsx` (optional)

These workbooks:

- Should be **derived from** `02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv`
- Must **not** contain FMEA content that isn’t reflected in the CSV
- Can include filters, pivot tables, conditional formatting, etc.

If you don’t need Excel, you can omit these entirely.

---

## 2. Purpose

The FMEA assets support structured analysis of:

- **Operations data publication pipeline**
  - ETL, ingestion, CSDB/publication, distribution channels.
- **Training phase for operations personnel**
  - How training materials and processes affect error rates and mitigations.
- **Deployment phase for operations systems**
  - How rollout, configuration, and tooling changes can introduce failure modes.

All FMEA work here must:

- Align with the **Certification Safety Objectives — ATA 02**.
- Be traceable to **hazards**, **requirements**, and **tests**.

## 3. Usage

### 3.1 Working with the canonical FMEA CSV

1. **Open** `../02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv` in your preferred CSV editor  
   (Git-friendly tools recommended: VS Code, plain text editors, or CSV-aware plugins).

2. **Add or update rows** with:
   - Clear `Function/Item` and `Failure_Mode`
   - Causes (`NN/IT_Cause`) and effects (`Local_Effect`, `System_Effect`, `Ops_Effect`)
   - `Detection_Method` and `Mitigation/Compensation`
   - Safety attributes (`Severity`, `Probability`, `DAL`)
   - `References` to:
     - Hazards (e.g. `H-02-001`)
     - Requirements (e.g. `S-02-REQ-001`)
     - ERP/Monitoring docs, tests, or CCA/FTA nodes

3. **Commit** changes to the CSV as the authoritative record.

### 3.2 (Optional) Using Excel as a view

If you prefer Excel for editing/visualization:

1. **Import the CSV**
   - Use the CSV as input and **do not rename or move** the CSV.
2. **Apply filters/pivots** as needed for analysis.
3. **Export back to CSV** (preserving columns and delimiters) or manually update the CSV based on workbook findings.
4. Ensure **all content changes** end up in  
   `02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv`.

> Rule: If content is only in `.xlsx` and not in the CSV, it’s **not part of the safety record**.

## What to do next / how to approach this

1. **Create / update the canonical CSV**
   - Ensure `../02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv` exists with the agreed columns.
   - Port any existing Excel-only content into this CSV and retire those workbooks as primary sources.

2. **Treat Excel purely as an optional view**
   - If teams need Excel:
     - Mark the `.xlsx` files clearly as “View only – CSV is the source of truth”.
     - Consider generating them from the CSV via a script or pipeline to avoid drift.

3. **Optimize the workflow**
   - Add to your safety/PR checklist:
     - “FMEA updated in `02-00-02-004A_Failure_Modes_Effects_Analysis.csv`?”
     - “No safety-significant content only stored in `.xlsx` files?”
   - Encourage code-review of FMEA changes via CSV diffs (much easier and more auditable).

4. **Extend automation later**
   - Introduce a small CI check that:
     - Validates FMEA CSV structure (required columns).
     - Flags if any `.xlsx` in this folder has newer timestamps than the CSV (potential drift).
