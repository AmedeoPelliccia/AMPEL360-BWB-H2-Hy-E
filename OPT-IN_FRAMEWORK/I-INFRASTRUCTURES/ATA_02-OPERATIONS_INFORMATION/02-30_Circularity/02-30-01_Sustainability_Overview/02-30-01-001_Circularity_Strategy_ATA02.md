# Circularity Strategy for ATA 02

## 1. Vision

**Enable AMPEL360's carbon-negative aviation mission through systematic circular economy practices in digital operations, achieving 60% carbon footprint reduction by 2028 while delivering operational excellence.**

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 AMPEL360 Mission Alignment

The ATA 02 circularity strategy directly supports the **world's first carbon-negative commercial aircraft** by:

- **Minimizing operational carbon footprint** of digital infrastructure supporting flight operations
- **Enabling aircraft-level carbon reductions** through optimized flight planning, performance computing, and predictive maintenance
- **Demonstrating environmental leadership** through transparent reporting and industry-leading practices
- **Creating economic value** through resource efficiency and operational optimization

### 2.2 Digital Operations Context

ATA 02 digital operations encompass:
- **~250 tCO₂e/month** baseline carbon footprint (2024)
- **€50M+** annual IT infrastructure and operations budget
- **1000+** hardware assets (servers, storage, edge devices)
- **100+ TB** data storage capacity
- **50+** software applications and services
- **10+** AI/ML models in production

**Opportunity**: Digital operations are inherently more controllable and measurable than physical manufacturing, making them ideal for rapid circularity improvements.

## 3. Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: Resource Optimization

**Objective**: Minimize energy and material consumption while maintaining or improving performance.

**Key Initiatives**:
- **Green Data Centers**: Migrate to facilities with PUE < 1.3 and 100% renewable energy
- **Edge Computing**: Offload 35%+ of compute to energy-efficient edge devices
- **Code Efficiency**: Achieve 75+ efficiency score through optimized algorithms and architectures
- **Storage Tiering**: Move 60%+ of inactive data to energy-efficient cold storage

**Target**: 50% reduction in energy consumption per transaction by 2028

### Pillar 2: Lifecycle Extension

**Objective**: Maximize useful lifetime of hardware and software systems.

**Key Initiatives**:
- **Modular Hardware**: Design systems with replaceable components (batteries, memory, storage)
- **Software Updates**: OTA updates extend device capability without hardware replacement
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Prevent premature failures through AI-driven monitoring
- **Refurbishment Programs**: Extend server/device life by 3-5 years through professional refurbishment

**Target**: Increase average hardware lifetime from 4 to 6+ years by 2027

### Pillar 3: Circular Flows

**Objective**: Close material and information loops through reuse, refurbishment, and recycling.

**Key Initiatives**:
- **Hardware Reuse**: 80%+ of decommissioned hardware reused, refurbished, or recycled (vs. waste)
- **E-Waste Management**: 95%+ diversion from landfill through certified recycling partners
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Systematic deletion of data past retention requirements
- **Knowledge Reuse**: Capture and transfer operational knowledge across aircraft generations

**Target**: Achieve 80% hardware reuse rate and 95% e-waste diversion by 2026

### Pillar 4: Transparency & Governance

**Objective**: Enable informed decisions through comprehensive measurement, reporting, and accountability.

**Key Initiatives**:
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Circularity metrics visible to all stakeholders
- **Digital Product Passports**: Track component provenance and lifecycle events
- **Automated ESG Reporting**: Generate compliance reports from operational data
- **Third-Party Verification**: Annual independent assurance of carbon accounting

**Target**: 100% of material circularity metrics verified annually by 2026
