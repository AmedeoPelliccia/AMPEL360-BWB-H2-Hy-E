## 1. Overview

This compliance pack implements the requirements of **EU Regulation 2023/2405** (ReFuelEU Aviation) for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft program. It provides comprehensive documentation, data models, workflows, and validation rules to ensure full regulatory compliance.

### Purpose

To establish a structured framework for:
- Operator reporting obligations (Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) management and verification
- Hydrogen and electricity infrastructure readiness tracking
- Flight Emissions Label (FEL) integration per Article 14
- Continuous Integration validation for compliance data

### Scope

This pack covers all operational and reporting requirements for AMPEL360 aircraft operators flying to/from Union airports, including:
- Fuel uplift discipline and refuelling obligations
- SAF procurement, quality verification, and lifecycle emissions
- Exemption procedures for temporary route adjustments
- Airport readiness for hydrogen/electric propulsion
- Environmental labelling for passenger transparency

- Template: [02-90-01-A001_Templates/ReFuelEU_Article8_Report_Template.xlsx](02-90-01-A001_Templates/ReFuelEU_Article8_Report_Template.xlsx)

### 3.5 SAF Claiming & Verification (Art. 9)

**Requirement:** 
- No double-claiming of SAF across multiple GHG reduction schemes
- Suppliers must provide SAF information by **14 February** annually
- Unique SAF purchase IDs required for traceability

**Validation:** See [02-90-01-007A_CI_Validation_Rules.md](02-90-01-007A_CI_Validation_Rules.md)

### 3.6 Flight Emissions Label (Art. 14)

**Requirement:** Voluntary environmental labelling scheme showing:
- Expected CO₂ emissions per passenger
- CO₂ efficiency per passenger-kilometer
- Valid for ≤1 year per route-period

**Process:**
1. Prepare dataset (fleet, routes, loads, fuel, SAF share/LCA)
2. Submit request to EASA
3. Receive label with standardized display template
4. Publish consistently in booking channels

**Documentation:** See [02-90-01-006A_FEL_Method_Art14.md](02-90-01-006A_FEL_Method_Art14.md)
