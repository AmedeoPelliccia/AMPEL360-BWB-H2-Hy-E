# 02-70-07 — Flight Planning Integration

## Purpose

Integration of propulsion performance data with flight planning systems for route optimization, power settings, alternate selection, and weather impact analysis.

## Scope

- Route performance optimization with propulsion constraints
- Recommended power settings by flight phase
- Alternate airport analysis considering propulsion range/performance
- Weather impact corrections for propulsion performance
