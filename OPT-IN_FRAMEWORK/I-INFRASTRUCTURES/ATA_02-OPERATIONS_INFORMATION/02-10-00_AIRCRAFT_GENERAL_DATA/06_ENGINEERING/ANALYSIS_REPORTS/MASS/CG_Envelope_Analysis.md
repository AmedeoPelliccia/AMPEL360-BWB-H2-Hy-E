# Center of Gravity Envelope Analysis

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-10-00-MASS-002  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Frozen Baseline  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the frozen CG envelope limits for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft. These limits ensure stable flight characteristics across all loading conditions.

## 2. CG Envelope Limits

### 2.1 Longitudinal CG Limits

The following CG limits are expressed as % MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord):

- Forward limit: **18.0 % MAC** (most restrictive at MTOW)
- Aft limit: **36.0 % MAC** (most restrictive at OEW)

**MAC Reference:**
- MAC length: 22.5 m
- MAC leading edge: Station 15.0 m
- MAC position: Buttline 8.5 m

### 2.2 CG Envelope Corners

| Condition | Weight (kg) | CG (% MAC) | Station (m) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| OEW - Forward | 95000 | 18.0 | 19.05 |
| OEW - Aft | 95000 | 36.0 | 23.10 |
| MTOW - Forward | 186000 | 18.0 | 19.05 |
| MTOW - Aft | 186000 | 36.0 | 23.10 |
| MZFW - Forward | 140000 | 18.0 | 19.05 |
| MZFW - Aft | 140000 | 36.0 | 23.10 |

### 2.3 Critical Loading Cases

**Forward CG Limit (18.0% MAC):**
- Driven by: Pitch control authority at rotation
- Critical case: Full fuel, no payload (ferry flight)
- Controllability: Demonstrated at 1.2 Vs with aft stick

**Aft CG Limit (36.0% MAC):**
- Driven by: Static stability margin requirement
- Critical case: Empty fuel, full aft cargo
- Stability margin: 5% MAC minimum

## 3. CG Management

### 3.1 Fuel Management

The H₂ fuel system is distributed to minimize CG travel:
- Forward tank: 37 m³ at Station 8.0 m
- Center tank: 37 m³ at Station 15.0 m (MAC leading edge)
- Aft tank: 38 m³ at Station 22.0 m

**CG Travel During Fuel Burn:**
- Full to empty fuel: 2.5% MAC shift
- Managed by automated fuel sequencing

### 3.2 Payload Distribution

**Passenger Cabin:**
- Typical seating CG: 25% MAC (Station 20.6 m)
- Range: 22-28% MAC depending on load distribution

**Cargo Compartments:**
- Forward cargo: Station 12.0 m
- Aft cargo: Station 26.0 m
- Cargo loading limited to maintain CG within envelope

## 4. Verification

CG envelope verified through:
- Static stability analysis (wind tunnel + CFD)
- Dynamic stability analysis (6-DOF simulation)
- Control authority assessment (actuator sizing)

## 5. Compliance

CG limits satisfy:
- [CS-25.21](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27) (Proof of Compliance - Weights)
- [CS-25.143](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27) (General - Controllability and Maneuverability)
- [CS-25.173](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27) (Static Longitudinal Stability)

Any change to these frozen limits requires ECR approval and flight test validation.
