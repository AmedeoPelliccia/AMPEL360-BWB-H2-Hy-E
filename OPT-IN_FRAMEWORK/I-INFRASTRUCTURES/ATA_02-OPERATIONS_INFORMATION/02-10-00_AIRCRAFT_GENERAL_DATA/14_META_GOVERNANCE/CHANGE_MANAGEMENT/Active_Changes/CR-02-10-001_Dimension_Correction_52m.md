## 1. Change Description

### Current State
The initial aircraft design specifies a wingspan of 80 meters, which was based on preliminary aerodynamic optimization studies.

### Proposed Change
Correct the wingspan dimension from 80m to 52m to reflect refined design analysis and operational requirements.

### Rationale
1. **Airport Compatibility:** 52m wingspan aligns with ICAO Code Letter C, enabling access to a wider range of airports worldwide
2. **Structural Efficiency:** Optimized span reduces structural weight while maintaining aerodynamic performance
