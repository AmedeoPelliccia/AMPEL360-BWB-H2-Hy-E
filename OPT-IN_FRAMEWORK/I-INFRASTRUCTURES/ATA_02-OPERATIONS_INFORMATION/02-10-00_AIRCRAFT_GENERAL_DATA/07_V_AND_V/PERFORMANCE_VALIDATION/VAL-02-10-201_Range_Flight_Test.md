## 3. Test Method

### 3.1 Flight Test Approach
**Option 1: Actual Range Flight**
- Fly actual distance with payload simulation
- Monitor fuel consumption throughout flight
- Land with calculated reserves

- Fly representative mission segment
- Measure fuel consumption rate precisely
- Extrapolate to full range
- Multiple flight conditions tested

### 3.2 Test Configuration
- Aircraft weight: Maximum takeoff weight (185,000 kg)
- Fuel load: 8,000 kg H₂ (full tanks)
- Payload simulation: Ballast for 220 passengers + cargo
- Test instrumentation: Performance data acquisition system

### 3.3 Test Conditions
- Altitude: FL410 (cruise)
- Speed: M 0.85 (design cruise)
- Atmospheric conditions: ISA or corrected to ISA
- Weather: Avoid significant headwinds/tailwinds

---

## 4. Success Criteria

### 4.1 Acceptance Criteria
- **Demonstrated range ≥ 6,500 km** (with reserves)
- Fuel consumption matches or beats predictions
- Performance margins adequate
- No operational limitations identified

### 4.2 Pass/Fail Determination
- **Pass:** Range ≥ 6,500 km
- **Conditional:** Range 6,300 - 6,500 km (requires review)
- **Fail:** Range < 6,300 km
