## 1. Validation Objective

Validate that the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft achieves the specified cruise speed of Mach 0.85 at design cruise altitude with acceptable fuel efficiency and handling characteristics.

---

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 Design Requirement
- **Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-PERF-002
- **Parameter:** Cruise Speed
- **Target Value:** Mach 0.85 (design cruise)
- **Conditions:**
  - Cruise altitude: FL410 (41,000 ft)
  - Standard day (ISA)
  - Maximum cruise power setting
  - Clean configuration

### 2.2 Additional Performance Points

- Economy cruise: Mach 0.80

---

## 3. Test Method

### 3.1 Speed Build-Up Approach
1. Start at lower speeds (M 0.70)
2. Incrementally increase speed
3. Monitor aircraft behavior
4. Achieve M 0.85 cruise
5. Extend to M 0.89 (Vmo validation)

### 3.2 Test Points
- M 0.70 @ FL350
- M 0.75 @ FL370
- M 0.80 @ FL390
- M 0.82 @ FL400
- M 0.85 @ FL410 (primary test point)
- M 0.87 @ FL410
- M 0.89 @ FL410 (Vmo)

### 3.3 Data Collection
- True airspeed (TAS)
- Mach number
- Altitude
- Fuel flow rate
- Power setting
- Control positions
- Handling qualities
- Vibration levels
- Stability characteristics

---

## 4. Success Criteria

### 4.1 Speed Achievement
- Sustained M 0.85 cruise at FL410: ✅ Required
- Adequate power margin: ≥5%
- Fuel flow within predictions: ±5%
- Stable, controllable flight

### 4.2 Handling Qualities
- Level 1 handling qualities at cruise
- No buffet or vibration issues
- Control forces within normal range
- No tendency to dutch roll or other instabilities
