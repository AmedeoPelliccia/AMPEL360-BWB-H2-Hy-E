## ATA 02-10-00 AIRCRAFT GENERAL DATA - Performance Validation

**Validation ID:** VAL-02-10-203  
**Test Type:** Flight Test  
**Status:** 📋 Planned  
**Scheduled Date:** 2027-Q1  
**Target Completion:** 2027-Q1

## 1. Validation Objective

Validate that the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft achieves the specified service ceiling of 43,000 ft (FL430) with acceptable climb performance and operational capability.

---

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 Design Requirement
- **Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-PERF-003
- **Parameter:** Service Ceiling
- **Target Value:** 43,000 ft (FL430) minimum
- **Definition:** Altitude at which rate of climb = 100 ft/min
- **Conditions:**
  - Standard atmospheric conditions (ISA)
  - Maximum continuous power
  - Aircraft at mid-cruise weight

### 2.2 Related Performance
- Initial cruise altitude capability: FL410
- Maximum certified altitude: FL450
- Optimum altitude (best fuel economy): FL380-FL410

---

## 3. Test Method

### 3.1 Altitude Build-Up Approach
1. Start at normal cruise altitude (FL410)
2. Incrementally increase altitude
3. Measure climb performance at each level
4. Identify service ceiling (100 ft/min climb)
5. Test at maximum certified altitude if achievable

### 3.2 Test Points
- FL410: Baseline cruise
- FL420: Climb performance measurement
- FL430: Service ceiling validation
- FL440: Performance margin
- FL450: Maximum altitude (if achievable)

### 3.3 Data Collection
- Altitude
- Rate of climb
- True airspeed
- Power setting
- Fuel flow
- Outside air temperature
- Aircraft weight
- Handling characteristics
- Pressurization system performance

---

## 4. Success Criteria

### 4.1 Service Ceiling
- Achieve ≥100 ft/min climb at FL430: ✅ Required
- Sustainable cruise at FL410: ✅ Required
- Handling qualities adequate: Level 2 acceptable
- Systems perform adequately

### 4.2 Performance Margins
- Service ceiling ≥ FL430
- Comfortable operational ceiling: FL410
- Margin to maximum altitude: ≥1,000 ft

---

## 6. Safety Considerations

- Pressurization system verified before high altitude flight
- Hypoxia awareness and emergency procedures briefed
- Oxygen equipment tested and available
- Weather assessment (avoid turbulence at altitude)
- Emergency descent procedures reviewed
- Structural limits monitored (equivalent airspeed)

---

## 7. Expected Results

Based on design predictions:
- Service ceiling: ~44,000 ft (1,000 ft margin)
- Optimal cruise altitude: FL410
- Climb gradient at FL430: ~120 ft/min
- No operational limitations at target altitudes
