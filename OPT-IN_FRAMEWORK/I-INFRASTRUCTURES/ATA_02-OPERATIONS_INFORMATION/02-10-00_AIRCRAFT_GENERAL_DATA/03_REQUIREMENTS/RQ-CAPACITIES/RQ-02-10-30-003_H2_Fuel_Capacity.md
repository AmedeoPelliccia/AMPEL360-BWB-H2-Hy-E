# RQ-02-10-30-003: H₂ Fuel Capacity

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-30-003  
**Category:** Capacities  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft shall carry 8,000 kg of usable liquid hydrogen (LH₂) fuel to achieve the design range of 3,500 NM with reserves.

**H₂ Fuel System Capacity:**
- **Usable Fuel:** 8,000 kg (17,637 lb)
- **Total Tank Capacity:** 8,500 kg (including trapped fuel)
- **Trapped/Unusable:** 500 kg (6%)
- **Volume (liquid):** 113.6 m³ @ -253°C

**Tank Configuration:**

| Tank | Location | Capacity (kg) | Volume (m³) | Type |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Tank 1 (Port) | FS 12-18, WS -8 to -4 | 2,000 | 28.4 | Type IV composite |
| Tank 2 (Center Fwd) | FS 10-16, WS -2 to +2 | 2,000 | 28.4 | Type IV composite |
| Tank 3 (Center Aft) | FS 20-26, WS -2 to +2 | 2,000 | 28.4 | Type IV composite |
| Tank 4 (Starboard) | FS 12-18, WS +4 to +8 | 2,000 | 28.4 | Type IV composite |

## Rationale

H₂ fuel capacity requirements ensure:
- Design range achievement (3,500 NM)
- Fuel reserves per regulations (45 min holding + alternate + final)
- CG management through multi-tank configuration
- Redundancy in fuel supply
- Weight optimization vs. conventional fuel

## H₂ Advantages

- **Energy Density:** 3× higher than Jet-A by weight (120 MJ/kg vs 43 MJ/kg)
- **Zero Emissions:** Only byproduct is water vapor
- **Carbon Negative:** Combined with CO₂ capture system

## Tank Technology

- **Type IV Composite:** Carbon fiber overwrap, aluminum liner
- **Insulation:** Vacuum-insulated, multi-layer (MLI)
- **Boil-Off Rate:** <0.5% per day
- **Operating Pressure:** 5-8 bar
- **Temperature:** -253°C (20K)

## Verification

- **Method:** Inspection
- **Procedure:** Tank capacity certification and fuel system testing
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Each tank holds specified capacity ±2%
  - Fuel transfer system operates per specification
  - Boil-off rate within limits
  - CG management system functions correctly
  - Leak rate <10⁻⁶ mbar·L/s

## Safety Considerations

- Tank separation and redundancy
- Fire protection and detection
- Venting system capacity
- Crash protection per CS-25.561
- Emergency fuel dump capability (if required)

## Compliance

- CS-25.954: Fuel system lightning protection
- CS-25.963: Fuel tanks: general
- CS-25.967: Fuel tank installation
- CS-25.969: Fuel tank expansion space
- ISO 19881: Gaseous hydrogen - Land vehicle fuel containers
- SAE AIR7165: Hydrogen Fuel System Safety
