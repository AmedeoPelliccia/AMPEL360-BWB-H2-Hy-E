# RQ-02-10-40-003: Service Ceiling

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-40-003  
**Category:** Performance  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft shall achieve a service ceiling of 45,000 ft (FL450) to provide operational flexibility, optimal cruise efficiency, and weather avoidance capability.

**Service Ceiling:** 45,000 ft (13,716 m)  
**Optimum Cruise Altitude:** 41,000 ft (12,497 m)  
**Initial Cruise Altitude:** 37,000-39,000 ft

## Performance at Service Ceiling

**At FL450:**
- Rate of Climb: 100 ft/min (minimum buffet-limited)
- Maximum Cruise Speed: M0.75
- Fuel Flow: 1,400 kg/h H₂
- Cabin Altitude: 8,000 ft (2,438 m)

## Rationale

High service ceiling provides:
- Access to optimal fuel efficiency altitudes
- Weather avoidance capability
- Turbulence mitigation
- Reduced air traffic congestion
- Improved range through step climbs
- BWB aerodynamic efficiency utilization at high altitude

## Altitude Optimization

**Step Climb Profile (typical):**
1. Initial cruise: FL370 (light weight)
2. First step: FL390 (after 2 hours cruise)
3. Second step: FL410 (after 4 hours cruise)
4. Final step: FL430 (near destination, light weight)

**Fuel Savings:** 3-5% compared to fixed altitude cruise

## Climb Performance

| Altitude | Time from Brake Release | Fuel Used (kg) |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------|
| FL100 | 4 min | 150 |
| FL200 | 9 min | 350 |
| FL300 | 15 min | 550 |
| FL370 | 22 min | 750 |
| FL410 | 28 min | 900 |
| FL450 | 38 min | 1,150 |

## Pressurization Requirements

**Cabin Pressurization System:**
- Maximum cabin altitude: 8,000 ft at FL450
- Cabin pressure differential: 9.1 psi
- Cabin altitude at cruise (FL410): 6,500 ft
- Enhanced passenger comfort vs. conventional (typically 7,500-8,000 ft)

## Verification

- **Method:** Flight Test
- **Procedure:** 
  - Climb performance measurement
  - Buffet boundary determination
  - Pressurization system validation
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Service ceiling ≥ 45,000 ft demonstrated
  - Buffet margin adequate (1.3g or M+0.05)
  - Climb performance meets predictions
  - Cabin pressurization maintained

## CAOS Optimization

- Optimal cruise altitude recommendation
- Step climb point calculation
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Adaptive altitude planning based on:
  - Weight
  - Temperature
  - Wind
  - Traffic

## Compliance

- CS-25.121: Climb: one-engine-inoperative
- CS-25.123: En-route flight paths
- CS-25.125: Landing
- CS-25.831: Ventilation
- CS-25.841: Pressurized cabins
