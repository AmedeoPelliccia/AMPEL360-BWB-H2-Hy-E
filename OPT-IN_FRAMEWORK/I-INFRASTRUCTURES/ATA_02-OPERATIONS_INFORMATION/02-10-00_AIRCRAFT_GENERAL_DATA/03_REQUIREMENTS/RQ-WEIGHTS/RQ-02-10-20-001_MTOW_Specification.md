# RQ-02-10-20-001: MTOW Specification

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-20-001  
**Category:** Weights  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) shall not exceed 185,000 kg to ensure structural integrity, performance targets, and regulatory compliance.

**MTOW:** 185,000 kg (407,855 lb)  
**Design Margin:** 5% structural reserve
**Certification Basis:** CS-25.25

## Breakdown

| Component | Weight (kg) | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Operating Empty Weight (OEW) | 95,000 | 51.4% |
| Payload (max) | 22,000 | 11.9% |
| H₂ Fuel (max usable) | 8,000 | 4.3% |
| Reserves & Margins | 50,000 | 27.0% |

## Rationale

MTOW limit ensures:
- Structural design limits not exceeded
- Landing gear load capacity compliance
- Brake energy absorption capability
- Takeoff and landing performance targets
- Airport pavement loading limits (PCN/ACN)
- Airframe fatigue life requirements

## Verification

- **Method:** Test
- **Procedure:** Weighing procedure per CS-25.25
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - As-built aircraft weight ≤ 185,000 kg
  - Weight breakdown documented and approved
  - Weight and balance report approved
  - Structural load analysis verified

## Compliance

- CS-25.25: Weight limits
- CS-25.473: Ground load conditions and assumptions
- CS-25.1581: General operating and flight information
