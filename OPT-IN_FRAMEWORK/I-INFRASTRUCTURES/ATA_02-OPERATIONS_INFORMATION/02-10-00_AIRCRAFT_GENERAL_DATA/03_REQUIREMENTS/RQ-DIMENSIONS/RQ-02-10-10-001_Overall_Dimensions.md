# RQ-02-10-10-001: Overall Dimensions

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-10-001  
**Category:** Dimensions  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft overall dimensions shall be as follows to ensure airport compatibility and operational efficiency:

**Wingspan:** 80.0 m ± 0.5 m (262.5 ft)  
**Overall Length:** 54.0 m ± 0.3 m (177.2 ft)  
**Overall Height:** 16.5 m ± 0.2 m (54.1 ft)  
**Wheel Track:** 24.0 m ± 0.2 m (78.7 ft)  
**Wheelbase:** 28.0 m ± 0.2 m (91.9 ft)

## Rationale
