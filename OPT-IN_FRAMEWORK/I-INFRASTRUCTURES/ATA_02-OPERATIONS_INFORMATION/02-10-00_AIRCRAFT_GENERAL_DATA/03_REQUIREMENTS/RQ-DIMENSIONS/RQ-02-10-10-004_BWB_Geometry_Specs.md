# RQ-02-10-10-004: BWB Geometry Specs

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-10-004  
**Category:** Dimensions  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The Blended Wing Body (BWB) geometry shall conform to the following specifications to achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity.

**BWB-Specific Geometry:**
- Center body width: 32.0 m (105.0 ft)
- Center body length: 42.0 m (137.8 ft)
- Wing-body blend radius: 8.0 m (26.2 ft)
- Outer wing span (each side from centerline): 24.0 m (78.7 ft)
- Wing sweep (leading edge): 35° ± 1°
- Wing thickness-to-chord ratio (root): 16%
- Wing thickness-to-chord ratio (tip): 11%
- Aspect ratio (effective): 8.5

**Cross-Sectional Area Distribution:**
- Maximum cross-section area: 185 m² at station FS 21.0
- Smooth area distribution per area rule
- Optimized for transonic drag reduction

## Rationale

BWB geometry requirements ensure:
- 30% aerodynamic efficiency improvement over conventional configuration
- Optimal lift distribution across entire body
- Structural efficiency through integrated design
- Passenger comfort in wide cabin configuration
- Reduced wave drag at cruise Mach number
- Stability and control characteristics
