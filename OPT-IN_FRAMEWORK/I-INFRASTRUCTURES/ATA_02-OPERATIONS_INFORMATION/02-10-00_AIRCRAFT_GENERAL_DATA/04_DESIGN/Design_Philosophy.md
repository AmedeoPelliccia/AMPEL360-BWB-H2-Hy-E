# Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- Safety: No compromise on safety for efficiency
- Sustainability: Net carbon-negative operations
- Efficiency: 30% improvement over conventional
- Innovation: BWB + H2 + CAOS integration
- Operability: Crew authority, CAOS advisory

**BWB Selection:** Aerodynamic efficiency, structural weight savings, noise reduction

**H2 Propulsion:** Zero direct emissions, 3× energy density advantage

**CAOS Integration:** Digital twin from inception, predictive maintenance, fleet learning
