**Result:** BWB scores 13% higher than conventional

## Aerodynamic Performance

### Lift-to-Drag Ratio

**Conventional:**
- Typical L/D: 17-18 (cruise)
- Fuselage: Pure drag (no lift generation)
- Wing interference: Drag penalty
- Wetted area: High relative to wing area

**BWB:**
- L/D: 21 (15-20% better)
- Entire surface: Generates lift
- Blended contours: Reduced interference drag
- Wetted area: 15% less for same payload

**Impact:**
- 15% less drag = 15% less fuel (H2)
- 15% less fuel = 15% less weight
- 15% less weight = Better performance
- Virtuous cycle: BWB compound benefits

### Cruise Efficiency

```
Range = (V × L/D / TSFC) × ln(Wi / Wf)

Conventional (L/D=17):
Range = 3,450 km (same fuel as AMPEL360)

BWB (L/D=21):
Range = 4,100 km (+19% range)
```

## Structural Advantages

### Weight Savings

**Load Distribution:**
- **Conventional:** Wing bending from fuselage weight
- **BWB:** Distributed load across entire span
- **Result:** 25% lower wing bending moment

**Material Efficiency:**
- **Conventional:** Fuselage carries pressure loads only
- **BWB:** Center body carries pressure + aerodynamic loads
- **Result:** 20% lower structural weight

**Weight Breakdown (220 pax, 4,000 km):**
| Component | Conventional | BWB | Savings |
|-----------|--------------|-----|---------|
| Wing Structure | 12,000 kg | 9,500 kg | 21% |
| Fuselage/Body | 18,000 kg | 14,500 kg | 19% |
| Empennage | 2,500 kg | 1,500 kg | 40% |
| **Total Airframe** | **32,500 kg** | **25,500 kg** | **22%** |

### Fatigue Life

**Stress Concentration:**
- **Conventional:** Wing-body junction (high stress)
- **BWB:** Smooth stress distribution
- **Result:** Improved fatigue life (+30%)

## H2 Integration

### Tank Volume

**Conventional Fuselage:**
- Cylindrical: 4-5m diameter
