## Capacity vs Range Trade

### Range Sensitivity

```
Breguet Range Equation:
Range ∝ (L/D / TSFC) × ln(MTOW / OEW)

Fuel Fraction Impact:
- More passengers → Higher OEW → Less fuel capacity → Less range
- Fewer passengers → Lower OEW → More fuel capacity → More range
```

**Analysis:**
| Capacity | OEW | Fuel | Range | Evaluation |
|----------|-----|------|-------|------------|
| 150 pax | 58,000 kg | 7,500 kg | 5,200 km | Over-ranged |
| 180 pax | 62,000 kg | 7,000 kg | 4,600 km | Balanced |
| **220 pax** | **66,500 kg** | **6,500 kg** | **4,000 km** | **Optimal** ✓ |
| 260 pax | 72,000 kg | 6,000 kg | 3,400 km | Under-ranged |
| 300 pax | 78,000 kg | 5,200 kg | 2,800 km | Too limited |

**Verdict:** 220 pax provides optimal range for target market

## H2 System Sizing

### Tank Volume Requirements

**Per Passenger Fuel:**
