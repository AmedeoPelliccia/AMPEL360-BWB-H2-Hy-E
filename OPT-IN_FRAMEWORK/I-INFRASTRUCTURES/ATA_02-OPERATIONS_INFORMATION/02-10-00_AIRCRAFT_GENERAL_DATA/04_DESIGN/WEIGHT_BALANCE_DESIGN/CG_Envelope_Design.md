# CG Envelope Design - BWB Specific

## Design Targets

**Forward:** 15% MAC (stability margin)  
**Aft:** 42% MAC (control authority)  
**Usable:** 27% MAC (vs 20% conventional)

## Loading Scenarios

**Most Forward:** Full pax forward, empty aft, H2 in wing tanks  
**Most Aft:** Full pax aft, cargo forward, H2 in center tanks  
**Critical:** Full pax + cargo + fuel - requires CAOS monitoring

## Design Features

- Real-time CG calculation (CAOS)
- Load planning software
- Automated fuel sequencing
- Crew alerts at ±2% from limits
