## 4. Runway and Taxiway Operations

### 4.1 Runway Requirements

**Takeoff Distance:**
- Required field length: 2,400 m (at MTOW, ISA+15°C)
- Code E minimum: 1,800 m
- Margin: +600 m ✅

**Landing Distance:**
- Required landing distance: 1,850 m (at MLW, wet runway)
- Code E capability: 1,800 m+
- Margin: Adequate ✅

### 4.2 Taxiway Operations

**Taxiway Width Clearance:**
- Required width: 23 m (Code E)
- Wingspan: 65.0 m
- Wingtip to taxiway edge: 9.5 m minimum
- Safe clearance: 0.5 m (pilot must maintain ±1.0 m centerline)

**Taxiway Turns:**
- Minimum radius: 57 m (Code E)
- BWB nose-to-main gear: 22 m
- Turn capability: Standard Code E turns ✅

### 4.3 Apron and Gate Operations

**Gate Compatibility:**
- Wide-body gates: Compatible (span similar to A380)
- Contact stands: Multiple jet bridges required (BWB width: 28 m)
- Remote stands: Preferred for H₂ operations
- Pushback: Specialized procedures (wide wingspan)

---

## 5. Special BWB Considerations

### 5.1 Ground Handling Challenges
**Wide Wingspan at Code E Limit:**
- 65.0 m wingspan = maximum for Code E
- Zero margin for span growth
- Critical centerline adherence required
- Enhanced ground monitoring (CAOS system)

**Pilot Visibility:**
- Limited wingtip visibility from cockpit
- Enhanced camera system required ✅
- CAOS AI proximity warning ✅
- Ground crew spotters required for close maneuvers

### 5.2 Ground Movement Procedures

**Standard Taxiing:**
- Maximum taxi speed: 20 kt (normal)
- Maximum taxi speed: 10 kt (tight turns)
- Required: Continuous wingtip monitoring
- CAOS alert threshold: 2.0 m proximity

**Taxiway Restrictions:**
- No operations on Code D taxiways
- Minimum taxiway width: 23 m (Code E)
- No concurrent taxiway operations if separation < 97.5 m
- Enhanced lighting required (wingtip illumination)

## 6. Infrastructure Requirements

### 6.1 Airport Modifications
**For BWB H₂ Operations:**
- H₂ refueling infrastructure ⚠️
- Wide-body gate modifications (optional)
- Enhanced ground lighting (wingtip visibility)
- Fire/rescue training (H₂ procedures)

**Investment Required:**
- H₂ infrastructure: $5-10M per airport
- Gate modifications: $0.5-2M per gate (if required)
- Training: $0.1M per airport

### 6.2 Ground Support Equipment
**Required GSE:**
- H₂ refueling truck (cryogenic)
- Wide-span tow tractors (180-ton capacity)
- Multiple jet bridges or passenger stairs
- Enhanced fire/rescue equipment (H₂ capability)

---

## 7. Operational Limitations
