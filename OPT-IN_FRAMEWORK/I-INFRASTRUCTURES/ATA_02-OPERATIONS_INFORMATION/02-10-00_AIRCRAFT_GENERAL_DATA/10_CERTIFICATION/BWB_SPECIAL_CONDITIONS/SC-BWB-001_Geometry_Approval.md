# SC-BWB-001: BWB Geometry Approval

**Document ID:** SC-BWB-001  
**Title:** Special Condition for Blended Wing Body Geometry Approval  
**Component:** 02-10-00 AIRCRAFT GENERAL DATA  
**Certification Area:** Special Conditions - BWB Configuration  
**Status:** Proposed to EASA  
**Date:** 2025-11-05

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This Special Condition addresses the unconventional Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration of the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Q100, for which existing CS-25 regulations do not provide explicit guidance.

**Configuration:** Blended Wing Body (no distinct fuselage/wing separation)  
**Certification Basis:** CS-25 + Special Condition SC-BWB-001  
**Status:** ⚠️ Requires EASA/FAA Approval

---

## 2. Background and Justification

### 2.1 Novel Design Feature
**Conventional Aircraft:**
- Clear distinction between fuselage (tube) and wing
- Passengers in cylindrical fuselage
- Wing generates all lift

**BWB Aircraft:**
- Integrated fuselage-wing planform
- Passengers distributed across center body
- **Entire planform generates lift**
- No conventional tail configuration

### 2.2 Regulatory Gap
**CS-25 Assumption:** Conventional tube-and-wing configuration  
**BWB Reality:** Integrated planform not explicitly covered

**Examples of Affected CS-25 Paragraphs:**
- CS-25.365: Pressurization (non-cylindrical cabin)
- CS-25.561: Emergency landing (non-tube structure)
- CS-25.783: Doors and exits (wide center body)
- CS-25.841: Pressurized cabins (distributed passenger area)

## 3. Proposed Special Condition

### 3.1 Special Condition Text

**SC-BWB-001: Blended Wing Body Configuration Approval**

*"Notwithstanding the provisions of CS-25 that presume a conventional tube-and-wing configuration, the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Q100 may utilize a Blended Wing Body configuration, provided that:*

- (2) Damage tolerance analysis for distributed passenger cabin
- (3) Crash impact analysis (CS-25.561/562/563) for BWB geometry
- (4) Pressure vessel integrity for non-cylindrical cabin sections

**(b) Emergency Egress:**  
Emergency exits shall be provided to enable evacuation within 90 seconds, considering:
- (1) Wide cabin configuration (up to 28 m width)
- (2) Multiple evacuation paths from center body
- (3) Exit distribution across planform geometry
- (4) Demonstration via full-scale evacuation test

**(c) Aerodynamic Certification:**  
Flight characteristics shall be demonstrated as safe and controllable, including:
- (1) Stall characteristics across wide CG range
- (2) Spin prevention/recovery (if applicable)

- (4) High-lift system performance with integrated flaps

**(d) Systems Integration:**  
All systems shall be certified considering BWB-specific aspects:
- (1) Distributed fuel tanks (see SC-BWB-003 for H₂)
- (2) Environmental control system for wide cabin
- (3) Fire protection for integrated structure
- (4) Lightning protection for large composite planform

**(e) Operational Considerations:**  
Flight operations shall account for BWB characteristics:
- (1) Ground handling with wide wingspan
- (2) Pilot visibility and camera systems
- (3) Maintenance access to distributed systems
