## 4. Landing Gear Structural Analysis

### 4.1 Landing Gear Loads

**Design Sink Rate:** 3.05 m/s (10 ft/s) per CS-25.473

**Vertical Load Factor at MLW:**

- Peak: 2.8 g (hard landing)
- Ultimate: 4.2 g (1.5 × 2.8)

**Total Vertical Load:**
- Limit: 2.8 × 150,000 = 420,000 kg
- Ultimate: 4.2 × 150,000 = 630,000 kg

### 4.2 Landing Gear Capability

**Main Landing Gear:**
- Configuration: 4 main gear assemblies (16 wheels total)
- Load per assembly: 105,000 kg (limit load at MLW)

- Tire rating: 35,000 kg (margin: 33%) ✅

**Energy Absorption:**
- Oleo-pneumatic shock struts
- Stroke: 0.45 m (18 inches)
- Energy absorption: 2.4 MJ per main gear
- Total capacity: 9.6 MJ ✅

## 5. Structural Considerations

### 5.1 Airframe Loads at MLW

**Wing Root Bending Moment:**
- At MTOW (1g): 45,000 kN·m
- At MLW (1g): 37,500 kN·m (83.3% reduction)
- At MLW (2.8g): 105,000 kN·m
- Structural capability: 112,500 kN·m (ultimate) ✅

**Fuselage Loads:**
- Distributed across BWB center body
- Lower stress concentration vs. conventional
- MLW provides 30% margin vs. MTOW loads

### 5.2 BWB Structural Efficiency

**Advantage at MLW:**
- Wide center body distributes landing loads
- Reduced peak stresses (no conventional fuselage tube)
- Composite structure: high strength-to-weight ratio
- 30% weight savings vs. conventional aluminum

## 6. Landing Performance

### 6.1 Landing Distance

**At MLW (150,000 kg):**
- Approach speed (Vref): 138 KIAS
- Landing distance (dry): 1,650 m (5,413 ft)
- Landing distance (wet): 1,850 m (6,070 ft)
- Required runway: 2,200 m (safety margin) ✅

**Comparison to ICAO Code E:**
- Typical Code E runway: 3,900 m
- Required at MLW: 2,200 m
- Margin: 77% ✅

### 6.2 Brake Energy

**Kinetic Energy at Touchdown:**
- MLW: 150,000 kg
- Speed: 71 m/s (138 kt)
- KE = ½mv²: 378 MJ

**Brake System Capacity:**
- Carbon brake discs (16 units)
- Energy per brake: 25 MJ

## 7. Operational Considerations

### 7.1 Normal Landing Operations

**Fuel Planning:**
- Typical flight: 4 hours at 575 kg/hr H₂
- Fuel burned: 2,300 kg
- Landing weight: 149,500 kg (below MLW) ✅

**Reserve Fuel:**
- Minimum reserve: 500 kg H₂ (30 minutes)
- Alternate fuel: Included in mission planning
- Total fuel at landing: 500-700 kg typical

### 7.2 Overweight Landing

**Emergency Overweight Landing:**
- Maximum structural capability: 165,000 kg (10% above MLW)
- Requires: Post-flight inspection
- Inspection areas: Landing gear, wing root, center body

**Fuel Dumping:**
- Not equipped (H₂ cannot be dumped safely)
- Alternative: Extended hold/circling to burn fuel
- Emergency: Accept overweight landing + inspection

### 7.3 H₂ Fuel Considerations

**Fuel Weight Impact:**
- H₂ very light: 3,000 kg maximum
- Minimal impact on landing weight
- Most missions land near MLW naturally
- No fuel jettison system required ✅

## 8. Special BWB Considerations

### 8.1 Load Distribution

**Landing Load Path:**
- Main gear → center body structure → wing box
- Distributed across 28m wide center body
- Lower peak stress vs. conventional narrow fuselage
- Composite materials optimized for landing loads

### 8.2 Ground Stability

**MLW Ground Stability:**
