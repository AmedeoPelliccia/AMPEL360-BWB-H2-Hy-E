3. Document deviations > ±5 mm
4. Photographic documentation (500+ images)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 95% of measured points within ±10 mm of nominal
- Zero deviations > ±20 mm in critical zones (doors, aisles, emergency equipment)

### 4.2 Ergonomic Assessment

**Participants:**
- 50 volunteers (range of anthropometry: 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male)
- 10 flight attendants (operational procedures evaluation)
- 4 pilots (cockpit ergonomics)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Passenger Boarding:**
   - Timed boarding (44 passengers, single door)
   - Baggage stowage (carry-on, overhead bins)
   - Seat access (window seats with occupied aisle seats)

2. **Emergency Egress:**
   - Evacuation time (all passengers, 2 doors)
   - Target: < 90 seconds (CS-25.803 requirement)
   - Crew coordination and command

3. **In-Service Operations:**
   - Galley workflow (meal service preparation)
