1. **Special Conditions Development:**
   - Propose BWB-specific special conditions to EASA
   - Address cabin pressure loads on wing-body structure
   - Define evacuation requirements for wide cabin layout
   - Establish ground clearance criteria

2. **Similarity Arguments:**
   - Leverage flying wing military experience
   - Reference NASA/Boeing BWB studies
   - Cite structural analysis methodologies

3. **Equivalent Safety Demonstration:**
