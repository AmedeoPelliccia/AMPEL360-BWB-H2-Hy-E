## 1. Regulatory Requirement

**CS-25.841 Pressurized Cabins**

Requirements for pressurized cabin design, including:
- Proof of structure (pressure differential)
- Pressurization controls and indication
- Emergency depressurization
- Door and hatch design

---

## 2. BWB Configuration Challenge

### 2.1 Novel Structural Configuration
The BWB integrates cabin pressurization into the wing-body structure, which differs fundamentally from conventional fuselage design:

**Conventional Aircraft:**
- Cylindrical fuselage optimized for pressure loads
- Clear separation between pressurized and unpressurized areas
- Established design and testing methods

**BWB Configuration:**
- Wide, flat cabin area integrated with wing structure
- Pressure loads distributed across wing-body surface
- Novel structural approach requiring special attention

### 2.2 Special Considerations
1. **Structural Loads:**
   - Pressure differential loads combined with flight loads
   - Wing bending effects on cabin structure
   - Fatigue analysis for combined loading

2. **Cabin Geometry:**
   - Wide cabin span (~60m) requires internal supports
   - Non-circular cross-section pressure containment
   - Door and emergency exit design for BWB shape

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Full-scale pressure test article
   - Combined loading validation
   - Fatigue testing program

---

## 3. Compliance Method

### 3.1 Analysis
- Finite element analysis of BWB pressure structure
- Combined load analysis (pressure + flight loads)
- Fatigue and damage tolerance analysis

### 3.2 Test
- Full-scale pressure test (planning)
- Ultimate pressure proof test
- Fatigue testing
- Door and seal testing

### 3.3 Test Evidence
- `TEST_EVIDENCE/Ground_Test_Results/Pressure_Tests/` (TBD)

## 4. Status

**Planning Phase:**
- Test article design in progress
- Test facility identification
- Special conditions coordination with EASA

**Timeline:**
- Pressure test: 2026-Q3
- Fatigue test: 2026-Q4
- EASA review: 2027-Q1
