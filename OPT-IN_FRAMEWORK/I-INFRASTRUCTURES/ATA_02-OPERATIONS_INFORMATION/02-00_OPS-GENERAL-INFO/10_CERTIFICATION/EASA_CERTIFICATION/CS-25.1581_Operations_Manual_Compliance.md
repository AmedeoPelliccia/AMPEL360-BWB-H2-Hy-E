## 1. Regulatory Requirement

**CS-25.1581 General**

The applicant must provide an Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) that complies with Appendix G and contains the information required by CS-25.1583 through CS-25.1589.

### Applicable Sub-Paragraphs
- CS-25.1581(a): General information
- CS-25.1581(b): Operating limitations
- CS-25.1581(c): Performance information
- CS-25.1581(d): Procedures and other information

## 2. BWB-Specific Considerations

### 2.1 Novel Configuration
The BWB configuration requires specific content additions to address:
- Wide-body cabin layout and passenger distribution
- Center of gravity management critical to flight control
- Ground clearance limitations
- Unique external dimensions and handling characteristics

### 2.2 AFM Sections Requiring BWB Content
1. **Limitations Section:**
   - CG range 15-42% MAC (more restrictive than conventional)
   - Lateral load distribution limits (500 kg maximum imbalance)
   - Ground clearance constraints
   - Rotation rate limits (5 deg/sec maximum)

2. **Normal Procedures:**
   - BWB-specific loading procedures
   - CG calculation and verification
   - Pre-flight external inspection (BWB-specific)
   - Ground maneuvering procedures

3. **Emergency Procedures:**
   - BWB evacuation procedures (wide cabin layout)
   - Emergency landing considerations (ground clearance)

4. **Performance:**
   - Takeoff and landing performance (BWB aerodynamics)
   - Climb gradient (BWB-specific)

## 3. H₂ System-Specific Content

### 3.1 Hydrogen Propulsion System
The AFM must include comprehensive H₂ system information:

1. **Limitations:**
   - H₂ fuel capacity: 8000 kg total, 7850 kg usable
   - H₂ storage temperature: -253°C
   - H₂ storage pressure: 2.8-3.2 bar
   - Boil-off rate: 0.3% per day maximum
   - Refueling time: 45 minutes maximum

2. **Operating Procedures:**
   - Pre-flight H₂ system checks
   - H₂ fuel quantity verification
   - Leak detection system operation
   - Fuel cell start procedures (cold/hot start)
   - Fuel cell shutdown procedures
   - Emergency defueling procedures

3. **Emergency Procedures:**
   - H₂ leak detection and response
   - Fuel cell malfunction procedures
   - Emergency ventilation activation
   - H₂ emergency shutdown

4. **Performance:**
   - H₂ fuel consumption rates
   - Range calculations with H₂ fuel
   - Fuel planning procedures

## 4. CAOS AI System Content

### 4.1 AI Operations
The AFM must address CAOS integration:

1. **General Description:**
   - CAOS architecture and capabilities
   - AI functions and limitations
   - Human authority and override

2. **Operating Procedures:**
   - CAOS system engagement
   - AI recommendation interpretation
   - Override procedures (single action)
   - CAOS monitoring requirements

3. **Limitations:**
   - Crew final authority maintained
   - CAOS advisory nature
   - Conditions requiring CAOS disengagement

---

## 5. Compliance Method

### 5.1 Analysis
**Approach:**
- Comprehensive AFM developed per CS-25 Appendix G
- BWB-specific content identified and integrated
- H₂ system procedures documented
- CAOS AI integration described
- Review by certification authorities

### 5.2 Documentation
**AFM Structure:**
1. Title and record of revisions
2. Table of contents
3. Limitations (including BWB, H₂, CAOS)
4. Normal procedures (including novel systems)
5. Emergency procedures (comprehensive)
6. Performance information (BWB aerodynamics, H₂ efficiency)
7. Weight and balance (BWB-specific CG management)
8. Systems description (BWB, H₂, CAOS)
9. Handling and servicing (H₂ refueling, ground operations)
10. Safety information (H₂ safety, emergency response)
