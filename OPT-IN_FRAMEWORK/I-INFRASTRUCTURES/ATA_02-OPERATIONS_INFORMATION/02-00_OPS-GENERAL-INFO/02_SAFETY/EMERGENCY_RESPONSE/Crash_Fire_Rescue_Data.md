**Classification:** Safety Critical

## Purpose

This document provides critical information for Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) personnel responding to emergencies involving the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA aircraft. Special attention is given to hydrogen fuel hazards and BWB configuration considerations.

## Aircraft Identification

**Type:** AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA  
**Configuration:** Blended Wing Body  
**Propulsion:** Hydrogen fuel cell electric  
**Capacity:** 220 passengers + 4 crew  
**ICAO Code:** A360 (pending)  
**Registration Prefix:** EC-XXX (Spain)

## Critical Hazards - HYDROGEN FUEL

### ⚠️ PRIMARY HAZARD: HYDROGEN

**IMMEDIATE DANGERS:**
- **EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE** - Wide explosive range (4-75% in air)
- **INVISIBLE FLAME** - Cannot see H₂ fire in daylight
- **CRYOGENIC** - Liquid H₂ at -253°C (-423°F) causes instant frostbite
- **ASPHYXIANT** - Displaces oxygen in confined spaces
- **LOW IGNITION ENERGY** - Static electricity can ignite

### Approach Procedures

**MANDATORY - BEFORE APPROACHING:**
1. **Wind Direction** - Approach from UPWIND ONLY
2. **Thermal Imaging** - Use thermal camera to detect invisible H₂ fire
3. **H₂ Detector** - Use portable H₂ detector if available
4. **50m Safety Zone** - Establish if H₂ leak suspected
5. **No Ignition Sources** - No smoking, engines off, intrinsic equipment only

**IF H₂ LEAK OR FIRE SUSPECTED:**
- **DO NOT** approach until H₂ concentration measured <10% LEL
- **EVACUATE** all non-essential personnel 50m minimum
- **VENTILATE** if indoors - H₂ rises, vent from high points
- **COOLING** - Water spray for cooling (NOT suppression), stay upwind
- **FIRE FIGHTING** - Let H₂ burn if safe to do so, prevent spread

## H₂ Storage Locations

### Hydrogen Tanks (Cryogenic)

**Location:** Aft body section, above cabin floor
**Capacity:** Approximately 1,000 kg H₂
**Pressure:** 6 bar (liquid)
**Temperature:** -253°C (-423°F)

**Visual Identification:**
- Yellow/black "HYDROGEN - FLAMMABLE GAS" placards
- Located on aft fuselage sides
- Tank access panels clearly marked

**Emergency Actions:**
- Cool tanks with water if fire nearby (from upwind)
- Do NOT directly spray tanks if leaking
- Allow 50m exclusion zone if tank integrity questionable
- Monitor wind direction continuously

### Fuel Lines

**Routing:** From aft tanks forward to fuel cell compartment (mid-body)
**Protection:** Double-wall lines with leak detection
**Isolation:** Emergency shutoff valves (automatic + manual)

**Emergency Actions:**
- Look for frost indicating cryogenic leak
- Use thermal imaging to detect fires
- Isolate if possible (shutoff controls in flight deck)

## Fire Detection and Suppression Systems

### Onboard Fire Suppression

**H₂ Compartments:**
- Agent: HFC-227ea (Halon alternative)
- Activation: Automatic at 40% LEL or manual
- Bottles: 2 per compartment (redundant)

**CFR Actions:**
- If onboard suppression activated, wait 60 seconds before entry
- Verify fire suppressed with thermal imaging
- Full PPE and SCBA required for entry

### Fire Fighting Strategy

**H₂ Fire:**
1. **Primary Strategy:** Let burn if no threat to structure
2. **Cooling:** Apply water to surrounding structure from upwind
3. **Ventilation:** H₂ disperses rapidly if outdoors
4. **DO NOT** attempt to extinguish unless leak can be stopped
5. **Extinguishing leak-fed fire** creates explosive vapor cloud

**Conventional Fire:**
- Use standard ARFF foam for other materials
- Water for cooling
- Standard CAF (Compressed Air Foam) techniques

## Aircraft Access Points

### Emergency Access for CFR

**6 Emergency Access Panels** (marked with red triangles):

1. **Forward Port** - Frame 10, 2m from nose
2. **Forward Starboard** - Frame 10, 2m from nose
3. **Mid-Body Port** - Frame 50, mid-cabin
4. **Mid-Body Starboard** - Frame 50, mid-cabin
5. **Aft Port** - Frame 90, aft cabin
6. **Aft Starboard** - Frame 90, aft cabin

**Panel Dimensions:** 24" × 24" (0.6m × 0.6m)
**Cutting:** Standard CFR cutting tools
**Safety:** Check for H₂ before cutting (use detector)

### Emergency Exits (Passenger Evacuation)

**Type A Exits:** 4 (forward and aft sides)
- Dimensions: 42" × 72"
- Height: 6 ft from ground (with slide)

**Type III Exits:** 8 (distributed along BWB perimeter)
- Dimensions: 20" × 36"
- Height: Varies 4-8 ft from ground

**CFR Entry:** Type A exits provide best CFR access if needed

## Electrical Hazards

### Fuel Cell Electrical System

**High Voltage:** 800V DC bus
**Location:** Mid-body, below cabin floor
**Indicators:** Yellow "HIGH VOLTAGE" placards
**Capacity:** 4 independent fuel cell stacks

**Safety:**
- Assume energized unless confirmed de-energized
- Use insulated tools and equipment
- Do not cut into marked high-voltage areas
- Water is conductive - use caution with 800V systems

### Battery Systems

**Location:** Forward fuselage, below cabin floor
**Type:** Lithium-ion (28V and 800V)
**Capacity:** 150 kWh total
**Fire Risk:** Thermal runaway possible

**Battery Fire:**
- Requires large quantities of water
- Expect prolonged firefighting (thermal runaway)
- Monitor for re-ignition up to 24 hours
- Ventilate gases (toxic)

## Communication with Flight Deck

### CFR Communication Port

**Location:** Forward fuselage, port side, nose gear door
**Marking:** "CFR COMMS" label
**Type:** Acoustic intercom (no power required)
**Use:** Lift cover, press to talk

**Information to Request:**
- H₂ fuel status (leak, quantity)
- Passengers remaining aboard
- Fire location and status
- Fuel cell and electrical status
- Crew assistance available

## BWB-Specific Considerations

### Wide Fuselage

- **Width:** 20m (65 ft) maximum
- **Access:** Multiple entry points required for full coverage
- **Equipment:** Extended reach tools may be necessary
- **Crew:** More personnel needed than conventional aircraft

### Underside Clearance

- **Minimum Clearance:** 1.2m (4 ft) at lowest point
- **Access:** Possible for personnel crawling
- **Hazards:** Limited visibility, potential H₂ accumulation

### Tail Height

- **Vertical Stabilizers:** 8m (26 ft) above ground
- **Access:** Aerial equipment required
- **Stability:** BWB design provides good ground stability

## Evacuation Support

### CFR Responsibilities

1. **Secure Perimeter** - Control bystanders, vehicles
2. **Wind Awareness** - Position upwind of H₂ hazard
3. **Slide Guards** - Personnel at each slide to assist
4. **Crowd Control** - Direct passengers away from aircraft
5. **Medical Triage** - Establish triage area upwind
6. **Accountability** - Coordinate with crew for passenger count

### Passenger Capacity

- **Total:** 220 passengers + 4 crew
- **Mobility Impaired:** Up to 10 (varies by flight)
- **Evacuation Time:** 75 seconds demonstrated (all exits)

## Post-Incident Actions

### Scene Security

- Preserve flight deck if possible

### Environmental

- **H₂ Dispersion:** Environmentally benign (water vapor)
- **Fuel Cell Fluids:** Minimal environmental impact
- **Coolant:** Glycol-based, standard precautions
- **Battery:** Lithium-ion, special disposal required
