## Overview

Hydrogen refueling procedure for AMPEL360 BWB H2 Hy-E aircraft.

## Safety Requirements

### Pre-Refueling Safety Checks
1. Area clear of ignition sources (50m minimum)
2. Fire equipment positioned and ready
3. Grounding connections verified
4. Weather conditions suitable (wind, lightning)
5. Emergency procedures reviewed

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Cryogenic gloves (mandatory)
- Face shield (mandatory)
- Fire-resistant clothing
- Safety footwear

## Refueling Procedure

### 1. Aircraft Preparation
1. Aircraft - PARKED, CHOCKED
2. All electrical systems - OFF
3. Passengers - DEPLANED
4. H2 tank pressure - VERIFY
5. Tank temperature - CHECK

### 2. Ground Equipment Connection

2. H2 refueling nozzle - POSITION
3. Verify coupling integrity
4. Communication link - ESTABLISH
5. Ground operator - READY

### 3. Refueling Sequence
1. H2 tank vent - OPEN
2. Pre-cool procedure - EXECUTE
3. Begin slow fill (10% flow rate)
4. Monitor tank pressure and temperature
5. Increase to normal fill rate
6. Monitor for leaks continuously
7. Fill to 95% capacity (safety margin)
8. Complete topping procedure

### 4. Post-Refueling
1. H2 flow - STOP
2. Depressurize connection
3. Disconnect refueling nozzle
4. Remove bonding cable
5. Verify tank integrity
6. Document refueling (quantity, time, pressure)

## Emergency Procedures During Refueling

### H2 Leak Detected
1. STOP REFUELING IMMEDIATELY
2. ACTIVATE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN
3. EVACUATE AREA
4. ALERT FIRE SERVICES
5. Monitor from safe distance

### Equipment Malfunction
