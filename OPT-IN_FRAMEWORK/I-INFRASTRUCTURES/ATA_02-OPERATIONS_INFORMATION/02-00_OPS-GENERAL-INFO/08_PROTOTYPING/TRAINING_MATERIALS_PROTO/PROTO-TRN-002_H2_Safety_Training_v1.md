**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Status:** Review  
**Lead:** Safety Department

## Hydrogen Safety Training Program

### Course Information
- **Duration:** 1 day (8 hours)
- **Audience:** All flight crew, ground crew, maintenance personnel
- **Prerequisite:** None
- **Recurrent:** Annually

## Module 1: Hydrogen Fundamentals (2 hours)

### Hydrogen Properties
**Physical Characteristics**
- Lightest element
- Colorless, odorless gas
- Extremely low density (0.089 kg/m³ at STP)
- Boiling point: -253°C (-423°F)

**Energy Characteristics**
- High energy density by weight (3× gasoline)
- Low energy density by volume
- Clean burning (only water as byproduct)

**Safety Characteristics**
- Wide flammability range (4-75% in air)
- Low ignition energy (0.02 mJ)
- Fast flame speed
- Buoyant (rises quickly)
- Difficult to detect (no odor, no color)

### Cryogenic Hazards
- Extreme cold burns
- Material embrittlement
- Asphyxiation risk in confined spaces
- Frostbite from contact

## Module 2: H₂ Detection & Monitoring (1.5 hours)

### Detection Systems
**Aircraft Systems**
- Multi-point H₂ sensors
- Continuous monitoring
- Automatic alerts
- Redundant detection

**Personal Detection**
- Portable H₂ detectors (mandatory)
- Visual indicators (frost formation)
- Audible alarms
- CAOS system warnings

### Monitoring Procedures
- Pre-flight sensor checks

- Post-flight inspection
- Maintenance checks

## Module 3: Personal Protective Equipment (1 hour)

### Required PPE for H₂ Operations

**Ground Operations (Refueling)**
- Cryogenic gloves (mandatory)
- Face shield or goggles (mandatory)
- Fire-resistant clothing
- Safety footwear
- Hard hat (if overhead work)

**Flight Operations**
- Standard flight crew uniform sufficient
- Emergency equipment briefing
- H₂-specific emergency equipment location

**Maintenance Operations**
- Full PPE as per ground operations
- Additional respiratory protection if confined space
- Grounding straps

### PPE Inspection & Maintenance
- Daily inspection requirements
- Replacement criteria
- Storage requirements

## Module 4: Safe Handling Procedures (2 hours)

### Refueling Safety
**Pre-Refueling Checks**
- Area clearance (50m minimum)
- Ignition source elimination
- Weather assessment
- Emergency equipment positioning
- Communication establishment

**During Refueling**
- Continuous monitoring
- Leak watch procedures
- Proper grounding
- No passengers on board
- Emergency response ready

**Post-Refueling**
- System integrity check
- Area inspection
- Documentation

### Aircraft Operations
**Normal Operations**
- Standard procedures adherence
- CAOS advisory monitoring
- System status awareness

**Ground Operations**
- No smoking within 50m
- No portable electronics near tanks
- Proper ventilation
- Bonding/grounding verification

## Module 5: Emergency Response (1.5 hours)

### H₂ Leak Response

**Flight Crew Actions**
1. Close H₂ main valve (memory item)
2. Shutdown fuel cells
3. Activate battery mode
4. Maximum ventilation
5. Land ASAP
6. Declare emergency

**Ground Crew Actions**
1. Stop refueling immediately
2. Activate emergency shutdown
3. Evacuate area (100m minimum)
4. Alert fire services
5. Monitor from safe distance
6. Do not attempt repair

### Fire Response
- H₂ fires are nearly invisible
- Do not attempt to fight large H₂ fire
- Evacuate and call fire services
- Small fires: dry powder or CO₂ extinguisher
- Never use water on cryogenic equipment

### Medical Emergencies
**Cold Burns/Frostbite**
- Remove from exposure
- Warm affected area gradually
- Do not rub frozen tissue
- Seek medical attention

**Asphyxiation**
- Remove from area immediately
- Fresh air
- Oxygen if available
- CPR if needed
- Medical attention

## Module 6: Regulatory & Standards (30 minutes)

### Aviation Regulations
- EASA regulations for H₂ aircraft
- FAA guidelines (if applicable)
- ICAO standards
- Local airport requirements

### Industry Standards
- ISO 19881 (Gaseous hydrogen — Land vehicle fuel containers)
- SAE standards for aerospace H₂ systems
- NFPA codes

## Practical Exercises

### Hands-On Training
1. PPE donning/doffing practice
2. H₂ detector operation
3. Emergency shutdown simulation
4. Leak detection practice
5. Fire extinguisher training

### Scenario-Based Training
