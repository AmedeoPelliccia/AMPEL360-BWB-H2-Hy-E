# Prototyping Plan - ATA 02-00-00 GENERAL Operations

**Document ID:** PROTO-PLAN-02-00-00  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Status:** Active

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the prototyping strategy for operational procedures, checklists, CAOS interfaces, training materials, and documentation for the AMPEL360 BWB H2 Hy-E aircraft.

## 2. Prototyping Objectives

- Develop and validate operational procedures before final publication
- Create user-friendly CAOS interface prototypes
- Design effective training materials for type rating
- Validate documentation formats with end users
- Gather pilot and maintenance feedback early in development

## 3. Prototyping Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Development (Q3 2025)
- Draft procedure prototypes
- Basic CAOS interface mockups
- Initial training material outlines

### Phase 2: Pilot Evaluation (Q4 2025)
- Focus group testing
- Usability assessments
- Feedback collection and analysis

### Phase 3: Refinement (Q1 2026)
- Incorporate pilot feedback
- Iterate on designs
- Validate improvements

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Q2 2026)
- Simulator testing
- Full scenario validation
- Certification preparation

## 4. Success Criteria

- 90% pilot acceptance rating
- Zero critical safety issues identified
- CAOS interface response time <100ms
- Training effectiveness >85%

## 5. Resources Required

- Flight test pilots (3-5)
- Subject matter experts (SMEs)
- Simulator time (50+ hours)
- CAOS development team

## 6. Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Pilot rejection of CAOS | Early engagement, iterative design |
| H2 procedure complexity | Comprehensive training, simplified checklists |
| Simulator availability | Book time 6 months in advance |
| Regulatory changes | Continuous EASA/FAA engagement |

## 7. Deliverables

- Validated operational procedures
- Certified training materials
- Production-ready CAOS interfaces
- Approved documentation formats
