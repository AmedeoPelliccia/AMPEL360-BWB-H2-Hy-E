# H₂ System Maintenance Plan
## Specialized Maintenance for Hydrogen Systems

## 1. Safety Requirements

All H₂ system maintenance requires:
- Trained and qualified personnel
- Proper PPE (cryogenic gloves, safety glasses)
- Adequate ventilation
- H₂ detection systems operational
- Fire suppression equipment available

## 2. Routine Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Visual inspection for damage/leaks
- Pressure and temperature verification
- Leak detection system test
- Vent system check

### A-Check Tasks (500 FH / 90 days)
- Leak detection system full test
- Pressure relief device inspection
- Valve operation verification
- Insulation visual inspection
- Connection torque check

### C-Check Tasks (3,000 FH / 18 months)
- Tank internal video inspection
- Pressure relief device functional test
- Valve disassembly and inspection
- Insulation vacuum level test
- Piping NDT inspection
- Ground straps continuity test

### D-Check Tasks (25,000 FH / 5 years)
- Complete tank inspection (borescope)
- Pressure vessel recertification
- All valves overhaul
- Complete insulation system inspection
- Piping replacement (as required)
- System hydrostatic test

## 3. CAOS Predictive Tasks

CAOS monitors H₂ system for:
- Insulation degradation
- Valve seal wear
- Pressure anomalies
- Leak risk assessment
- Performance degradation

## 4. Special Tools Required

- H₂ leak detector (sensitivity: 10 ppm)
- Cryogenic pressure gauges
- Vacuum gauge (10⁻⁶ torr range)
- Borescope (cryogenic rated)
- Torque wrenches (calibrated)
- Non-sparking hand tools

## 5. Consumables

- H₂-compatible thread sealant
- Cryogenic valve lubricant
- Gaskets and seals (H₂ service)
- Insulation repair materials
- Grounding straps

## 6. Documentation

All H₂ maintenance requires:
- Task card completion
- Inspection stamps
- Leak test results
- Pressure test records
- Photos of critical inspections
