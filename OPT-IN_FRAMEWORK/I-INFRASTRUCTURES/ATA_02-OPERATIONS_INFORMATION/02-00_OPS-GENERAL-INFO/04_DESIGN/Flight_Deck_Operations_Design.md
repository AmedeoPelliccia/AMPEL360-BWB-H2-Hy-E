5. Flight plan loading and verification

**Before Start:**
1. External inspection complete
2. Fuel quantity verification (H₂ and battery)
3. Weight and balance (CAOS-calculated)
4. Performance data review
5. Briefings complete

### Normal Operations

**Takeoff:**
- Standard takeoff procedures
- BWB rotation technique
- Fuel cell power management automatic
- CAOS monitoring active but non-intrusive

**Climb:**
- Standard climb profile
- CAOS optimization suggestions available

- Power management automatic

**Cruise:**
- Flight path optimization with CAOS
- Fuel cell efficiency monitoring
- H₂ system continuous monitoring
- Performance tracking

**Descent:**
- CAOS descent profile optimization
- Energy management
- Approach briefing
- Landing preparation

**Approach and Landing:**
- BWB-specific approach techniques
- Stable approach criteria
- CAOS monitoring minimal
- Standard callouts

### Post-Flight

**Shutdown:**
1. Fuel cell shutdown sequence
2. H₂ system securing
3. CAOS data upload
4. Post-flight inspection
5. Maintenance status review

## BWB-Specific Procedures

### Center of Gravity Management

**Loading Considerations:**
- CAOS real-time CG calculation
- Loading sequence optimization
- Verification before departure
- In-flight monitoring

**Flight Characteristics:**
- Unique pitch response
- Enhanced lateral stability
- Approach and landing technique
- Go-around considerations

### Special Procedures

**Non-Standard Operations:**
- Single fuel cell operation
- Degraded CAOS mode
- Emergency power modes
- Backup system operations

## CAOS Flight Deck Integration

### Advisory Management

**Normal Operations:**
- CAOS suggestions appear in advisory window
- Crew reviews and accepts/rejects
- Minor optimizations can auto-execute
- All actions reversible

**High Workload:**
- CAOS advisories minimized
- Only critical information displayed
- Declutter mode automatic
- Full system availability maintained

### Override Procedures

**CAOS Override:**
- Single button press
- Immediate effect
- Visual confirmation
- Reversion procedures clear

**Manual Mode:**
- All CAOS automation disabled
- Advisory still available
- Normal flight control maintained
- Performance slightly reduced

## H₂ System Flight Deck Procedures

### Normal Monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- H₂ pressure and temperature
- Leak detection status
- Fuel cell performance
- System health indicators

**Fuel Management:**
- H₂ quantity monitoring
- Consumption rate tracking
- Range calculations (CAOS-assisted)
- Reserve fuel management

### Abnormal Operations

**H₂ System Warnings:**
- Immediate crew alert
- Automated protective actions
- Manual intervention procedures
- Landing planning support

**Fuel Cell Issues:**
- Automatic load redistribution
- Manual override available
- Performance impact assessment
- Diversion considerations

## Crew Coordination

### Standard Calls

**Takeoff:**
- "Power set"
- "80 knots"
- "V1"
- "Rotate"
- "Positive rate, gear up"

**Landing:**
- "1000 feet" / "500 feet"
- "Stabilized"
- "100 feet"
- "50, 40, 30, 20, 10"

### CAOS-Related Calls

**Advisory Acceptance:**
- "CAOS altitude change, accepted"
- "CAOS route modification, rejected"

**Override:**
- "CAOS override, manual mode"

## Emergency Procedures

### General Philosophy

**Priority:**
1. Fly the aircraft
2. Analyze the situation
3. Take action
4. Land safely

### H₂ Emergency Response

**Major Leak:**
- Memory items (immediate isolation)
- Emergency checklist reference
- Landing site selection (CAOS-assisted)
- Emergency services notification

**Fuel Cell Failure:**
- Automatic system response
- Crew verification
- Performance assessment
- Diversion if necessary
