**CR Number**: CR-02-00-001  
**Title**: CAOS Integration Update  
**Date Submitted**: 2025-11-01  
**Submitted By**: Jane Doe, CAOS System Lead  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Classification**: Class B (Major)

## Change Description

### Current State
Current operations documentation has limited CAOS AI integration details. CAOS capabilities are described at high level but specific operational procedures and interfaces need expansion.

### Proposed Change
Add comprehensive CAOS integration documentation including:
- Digital twin operational procedures
- Predictive maintenance workflows  
- AI-assisted decision making processes
- Human-AI interaction protocols
- CAOS system interfaces with operations

### Justification
As CAOS system development has progressed, operational integration details are now defined and need to be documented for pilot operations and training.

**Interface Impact**: Yes - ICD-02-00-95-001 needs update  
**Regulatory Impact**: No - CAOS not safety-critical at this stage
