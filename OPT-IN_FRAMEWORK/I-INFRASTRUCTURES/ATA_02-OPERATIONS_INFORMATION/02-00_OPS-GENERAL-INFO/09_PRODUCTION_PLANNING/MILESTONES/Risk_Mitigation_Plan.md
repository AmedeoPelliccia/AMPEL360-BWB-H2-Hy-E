## High Priority Risks

### Risk 1: Type Rating Course Development Delays
**Category:** Schedule  
**Probability:** High (60%)  
**Impact:** Very High (Critical path item)  
**Risk Score:** 12/15

**Description:** Type rating course development is at risk due to SME availability constraints and complexity of BWB/H₂ training requirements.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Secure additional pilot SME (2 weeks)
   - Engage H₂ systems expert consultant (immediate)
   - Prioritize critical training modules
   
2. **Short-term Actions:**
   - Develop modular course structure for parallel development
   - Early simulator time booking
   - Simplified initial curriculum, enhanced in Phase 2

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Weekly progress reviews
   - SME availability tracking
   - Module completion metrics

**Contingency Plan:**
- Defer advanced training modules to recurrent training
- Utilize external training development firm
- Extend course duration if necessary (last resort)

### Risk 2: Regulatory Approval Delays
**Category:** Regulatory  
**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** Very High (Required for operations)  
**Risk Score:** 10/15

**Description:** Novel H₂ system and BWB configuration may require extended regulatory review and approval cycles.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Early Engagement:**
   - Monthly meetings with EASA/FAA (started)
   - Pre-submission reviews
   - Collaborative approach to novel items

2. **Documentation Quality:**
   - Comprehensive safety analysis
   - Clear technical justifications
   - Precedent research and citations

3. **Schedule Buffers:**
   - 6-week buffer in approval timeline
   - Parallel submission to multiple authorities
   - Expedited review request for critical items

**Contingency Plan:**
- Provisional operations authorization
- Phased approval approach
- Alternative compliance means

### Risk 3: SME Availability Constraints
**Category:** Resource  
**Probability:** High (65%)  
**Impact:** High (Affects quality and schedule)  
**Risk Score:** 11/15

**Description:** Limited availability of qualified SMEs for BWB, H₂ systems, and CAOS expertise.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Resource Planning:**
   - Advanced SME scheduling (6 months ahead)
   - Multiple SME sources for critical areas
   - Flexible scheduling arrangements

2. **Knowledge Capture:**
   - Video interview sessions
   - Detailed technical notes
   - Review cycles vs. creation involvement

3. **Alternative Resources:**
   - Industry consultant partnerships
   - Academic collaborations
   - Vendor technical support

**Contingency Plan:**
- Increase SME compensation
- Remote SME participation
- Extended timelines for SME-dependent activities

### Risk 4: CAOS System Development Delays
**Category:** Technical  
**Probability:** Medium (45%)  
**Impact:** High (Affects training and operations)  
**Risk Score:** 9/15

**Description:** CAOS software development may not meet production schedule, impacting training and documentation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Parallel Development:**
   - Training on CAOS prototype
   - Manual procedures documented first
   - Simulation environment for training

2. **Phased Deployment:**
   - Core functionality first
   - Advanced features in Phase 2
   - Incremental training updates

3. **Fallback Plans:**
   - Manual operation procedures
   - Simplified CAOS interface
   - Reduced feature set initially

**Contingency Plan:**
- Defer advanced CAOS features
- Enhanced manual procedures
- Simulator CAOS sufficient for initial training

### Risk 5: Translation Quality and Timeline
**Category:** Quality / Schedule  
**Probability:** Medium (50%)  
**Impact:** Medium (Required for international ops)  
**Risk Score:** 7.5/15

**Description:** Technical translation complexity and timeline constraints may affect quality or schedule.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Early Start:**
   - Translate stable sections early
   - Rolling translation process
   - Glossary and terminology database

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Bilingual SME reviews
   - Back-translation verification
   - Native speaker technical reviews

3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Dedicated translation project manager
   - Multiple translation firms
   - In-house translation capability

**Contingency Plan:**
- Prioritize critical documents
- Phase 2 for less critical translations
- English-only initial operations if necessary

## Medium Priority Risks

### Risk 6: Simulator Availability
**Probability:** Low (25%)  
**Impact:** Very High  
**Mitigation:** Early booking, multiple simulator options, fixed-base backup

### Risk 7: Performance Data Delays
**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Provisional data, parallel documentation, early test planning

### Risk 8: Budget Overruns
**Probability:** Medium (45%)  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** 10% contingency, phased spending, cost tracking

### Risk 9: Staff Turnover
**Probability:** Low (20%)  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Competitive compensation, knowledge documentation, overlap

### Risk 10: Print Production Quality
**Probability:** Low (15%)  
**Impact:** Low  
**Mitigation:** Proof reviews, vendor qualification, backup vendors
