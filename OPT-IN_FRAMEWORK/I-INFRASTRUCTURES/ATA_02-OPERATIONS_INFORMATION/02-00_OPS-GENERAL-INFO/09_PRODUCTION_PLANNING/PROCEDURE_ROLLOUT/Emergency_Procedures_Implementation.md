## Memory Items Development
### Critical Action Items (Bold-Face)
Immediate actions that must be memorized:
- Engine fire on ground
- Engine fire in flight
- H₂ system fire
- Rapid decompression
- Emergency descent
- Ditching preparation
- Emergency evacuation

### Memory Items Criteria
- Time-critical (seconds matter)
- Safety-critical (life/death)
- Simple (5 steps or less)
- Easily memorized
- Frequently practiced

## Procedure Development Process
### Phase 1: Hazard Analysis
- Identify all credible emergencies
- Assess probability and severity
- Determine required responses
- Define memory items vs checklist items

### Phase 2: Procedure Design
- Define immediate actions (memory items)
- Design checklist flows
- Establish decision points
- Define crew coordination
- Include CAOS considerations

### Phase 3: Validation
- Desktop analysis
- Simulator testing
- Pilot review and feedback
- Human factors assessment
- Regulatory review

### Phase 4: Documentation
- QRH integration
- FCOM inclusion
- Training material development
- Quick reference cards
- Cockpit placards

## Training Strategy
### Ground Training
- Emergency systems knowledge
- Procedure memorization (memory items)
- Decision-making framework
- Crew coordination
- Human factors awareness

### Simulator Training
- Normal → emergency transitions
- Memory items practice
- Full procedure execution
- Crew coordination
- Decision-making under stress
- Multiple failure scenarios

### Recurrent Training
- Annual refresher
- Memory items verification
- New scenario introduction
- Lessons learned integration

## Implementation Schedule

- Range calculations
- Diversion planning
- Emergency fuel conservation
- Priority landing

## CAOS Emergency Integration
### CAOS Failure Procedures
- Recognition of CAOS failure
- Manual operation fallback
- Communication protocols
- Decision-making without AI
- Workload management

### CAOS-Assisted Emergency Response
- Emergency advisory interpretation
- Procedure guidance
- System status information
- Decision support
- Override when necessary

## Crew Resource Management in Emergencies
### Task Distribution
- Pilot flying responsibilities
- Pilot monitoring responsibilities
- Communication protocols
- Authority gradient management

### Decision Making
- Threat and error management
- Time-critical decisions
- Resource assessment
- Alternative evaluation
- Commitment and action

## Quality Assurance
### Procedure Effectiveness
- Simulator validation data
- Time to complete assessments
- Error rate analysis
- Crew feedback
- Safety margins verification

### Compliance Monitoring
- Line observations
- Proficiency checks
- Incident/accident analysis
- Continuous improvement

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Novel H₂ emergencies unforeseen | High | Conservative procedures, continuous learning |
| Memory item overload | Medium | Limit to truly critical items, regular practice |
| CAOS failure compounding emergency | High | Manual procedures always available |
| Crew stress/confusion | High | Simple procedures, extensive training |

## Success Metrics
- 100% crew proficiency in memory items
- <10 seconds average memory item completion
- >95% procedure completion accuracy
- Zero safety events due to procedure inadequacy
- Positive crew confidence in emergency preparedness

## Deliverables
- Emergency Procedures Manual
- Memory Items List
- QRH Emergency Section
- Training Materials
- Simulator Scenarios
- Quick Reference Cards
- Crew Briefing Materials
