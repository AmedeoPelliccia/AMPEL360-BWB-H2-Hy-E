**Folder:** 09_PRODUCTION_PLANNING

## Document Control
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** Active
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-05
- **Owner:** Production Planning Team

## Purpose
This document outlines the master production plan for all AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E operational documentation, training materials, procedures, and CAOS system deployment.

## Overview
The Production Master Plan coordinates the development, review, approval, and distribution of all operational materials required for aircraft certification and entry into service.

### Key Production Streams
1. **Documentation Production** - Technical publications (AFM, FCOM, QRH, WBM, MEL)
2. **Training Production** - Type rating courses, CBT modules, simulator scenarios
3. **Procedure Rollout** - SOPs, emergency procedures, checklists
4. **CAOS Deployment** - Software rollout, digital twin, fleet integration
5. **Quality Control** - Review processes, translation, verification
6. **Distribution** - Digital and print distribution channels
7. **Resource Management** - Personnel, tools, budget tracking
8. **Milestones** - Critical path tracking, delivery schedules

## Production Philosophy
- **S1000D Compliance** - All technical documentation follows S1000D v6.0 standards
- **Modular Approach** - Reusable data modules for efficiency
- **Digital-First** - EFB and digital distribution prioritized
- **CAOS Integration** - AI-assisted content creation and validation
- **Continuous Improvement** - Feedback loops from operations to documentation

## Critical Success Factors
1. Subject Matter Expert (SME) availability and engagement
2. Early regulatory authority coordination
3. Adequate resource allocation across all streams
4. Robust change control process
5. Translation quality for international operations
6. CAOS platform stability and training effectiveness

## Production Governance
- **Weekly Status Reviews** - All stream leads
- **Monthly Steering Committee** - Executive oversight
- **Quarterly Milestone Reviews** - Board-level reporting
- **Daily Standups** - Individual production teams

## Risk Management
Key risks monitored continuously:
- SME availability constraints
- Regulatory requirement changes
- CAOS software development delays
- Translation bottlenecks
- Simulator availability for scenario validation
- Resource funding gaps

## Integration Points
- **Engineering (Folder 06)** - Technical specifications and data
- **V&V (Folder 07)** - Validation of procedures and training
- **Certification (Folder 10)** - Regulatory compliance demonstration
- **Operations & Maintenance (Folder 11)** - Operational feedback integration

## Production Metrics
- Document completion percentage
- Review cycle times
- Translation turnaround times
- Training module development velocity
- CAOS deployment progress
- Resource utilization rates
- Milestone adherence
