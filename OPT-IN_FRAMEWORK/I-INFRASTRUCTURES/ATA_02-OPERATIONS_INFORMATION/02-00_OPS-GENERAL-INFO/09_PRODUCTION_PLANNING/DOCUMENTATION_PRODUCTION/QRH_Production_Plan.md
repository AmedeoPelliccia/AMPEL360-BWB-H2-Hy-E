- Landing gear failures

### Section 2: Abnormal Procedures
- H₂ system abnormalities
- Fuel cell performance degradation
- CAOS system degradation
- Navigation system failures
- Communication failures
- Weather-related procedures
- Smoke/fumes/fire

### Section 3: Performance Data
- Emergency performance tables
- One-engine-inoperative data
- Diversion planning data
- H₂ system emergency fuel consumption

### Section 4: Limitations
- Quick-reference limitations
- Speed limitations
- Weight limitations
- System limitations

### Section 5: Checklists
- Emergency checklists
- Abnormal checklists
- Memory items (bold-face)
- Approach and landing checklists

## Production Schedule
| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Emergency procedure draft | 2026-02-01 | Planning |
| Abnormal procedure draft | 2026-02-28 | Planning |
| Performance data integration | 2026-03-15 | Planning |
| Flight crew review | 2026-03-31 | Planning |
| Simulator validation | 2026-04-15 | Planning |
| Final approval | 2026-05-15 | Planning |

## Dependencies
- **Emergency_Procedures**: Validated emergency response procedures
- **AFM_Data**: Performance limitations and data
- **FCOM_Procedures**: Normal procedures baseline
- **Simulator_Validation**: Procedure effectiveness testing
- **Regulatory_Approval**: Authority concurrence

## Resources Required
- Safety SME (100% allocation)
- Operations Pilot (60% allocation)
- Technical Writer (50% allocation)
- Flight Test Pilot (40% allocation)
- Graphic Designer (30% allocation)

## Quality Assurance
- Flight crew review and validation
- Flight simulator testing
- Human factors review
- Emergency response team validation
- Regulatory compliance check
- CAOS integration verification

## Design Requirements
- **Immediate Access**: Tab-indexed, color-coded sections
- **Clear Layout**: Large fonts, high contrast, minimal text
- **Memory Items**: Bold-face, easily identifiable
- **Performance Tables**: Quick-reference format
- **Digital Format**: EFB optimized, touch-friendly
- **Checklist Flow**: Logical, sequential, error-resistant

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Simulator availability delays | High | Early booking, virtual simulation backup |
| H₂ emergency procedures novel | High | Expert consultation, test program validation |
| Flight crew acceptance | Medium | Early pilot involvement, iterative reviews |
| CAOS failure scenarios | Medium | Comprehensive failure mode analysis |

## Special Considerations
- **H₂ System Emergencies**: Novel procedures require extensive validation
- **BWB Characteristics**: Unique handling in emergencies
- **CAOS Dependency**: Procedures for CAOS degradation/failure
- **Memory Items**: Critical actions must be memorized by crew
- **Digital Integration**: EFB must allow offline access

## Deliverables
- QRH Master Document (spiral-bound, quick-access format)
- Digital version for EFB (offline-capable)
- Training integration materials
- Memory items list
- Flashcards for crew training
- CAOS-integrated emergency guidance

## Validation Process
1. Desktop review by safety team
2. Simulator validation sessions
3. Flight test validation (where safe)
4. Crew feedback integration
5. Human factors assessment
6. Regulatory authority review
7. Final approval by Chief Pilot
