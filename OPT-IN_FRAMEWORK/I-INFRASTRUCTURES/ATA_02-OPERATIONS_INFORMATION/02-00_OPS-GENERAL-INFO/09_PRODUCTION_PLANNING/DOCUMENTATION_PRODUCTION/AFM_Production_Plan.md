## Dependencies
- **Performance_Data**: Flight test data, simulation results
- **H2_System_Specs**: Fuel cell performance, safety data
- **Regulatory_Compliance**: EASA/FAA certification requirements
- **BWB_Handling**: Unique flight characteristics data

## Resources Required
- Lead Technical Writer (100% allocation)
- Operations SME (40% allocation)
- H₂ Systems Engineer (30% allocation)
- Technical Illustrator (60% allocation)
- Regulatory Compliance Specialist (20% allocation)

## Quality Assurance
- Peer review by operations team
- Technical accuracy verification by SMEs
- Regulatory compliance check
- Format standards validation
- CAOS integration verification

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance data delays | High | Early test planning, simulation data backup |
| Regulatory requirement changes | Medium | Regular authority engagement |
| SME availability | Medium | Multiple SME sources, schedule flexibility |
| H₂ system certification delays | High | Parallel documentation development |

## Deliverables
- AFM Master Document (PDF, S1000D format)
- Digital version for EFB
- Printed copies for aircraft
