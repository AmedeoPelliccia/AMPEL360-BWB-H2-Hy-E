- Technical Illustrator (40% allocation)

## Quality Assurance
- Independent calculation verification
- Cross-check with AFM data
- Ground test validation
- Flight test validation
- CAOS calculation verification
- Regulatory compliance review

## Special Considerations
### BWB-Specific Challenges
- Wide CG range due to BWB configuration
- Unique loading zones
- Passenger seating arrangement effects
- Wide-body cargo loading patterns

### H₂ Fuel System Impact
- Cryogenic fuel density variations
- Tank placement effects on CG
- Fuel consumption CG shift patterns
- Boil-off weight considerations

### CAOS Integration
- Automated weight and balance calculations
- Real-time CG monitoring
- Load optimization algorithms
- Digital loading manifest integration

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Weight data measurement delays | High | Early test planning, provisional data |
| CG envelope changes | Medium | Conservative initial envelope, refinement process |
| CAOS software readiness | Medium | Manual procedures as backup |
| H₂ fuel density uncertainties | Medium | Conservative assumptions, test validation |

## Deliverables
- WBM Master Document (PDF and S1000D)
- Digital version for EFB
- Loading manifest templates
- CAOS weight and balance module
- Training materials
- Quick reference cards
- Translation source files

## Validation Process
1. Desktop calculations review
2. Ground test weight measurements
3. CG envelope flight testing
4. CAOS system validation
5. Regulatory authority review
6. Final approval by Performance team
