## Purpose

This document defines the operational concept for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 aircraft, establishing the foundational approach to how the aircraft will be operated, maintained, and supported throughout its lifecycle.

## Operational Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Safety First:**
- All operations prioritize safety above efficiency
- Multiple layers of protection for critical systems
- Fail-safe design philosophy throughout

**Sustainable Operations:**
- Zero local emissions through hydrogen fuel cells
- Carbon-negative flights via CO₂ capture
- Minimal environmental impact in all phases

**Technology-Enhanced:**
- CAOS AI system optimizes routine operations
- Digital twin enables predictive maintenance
- Fleet learning improves operations continuously

## CAOS Integration Concept

**Advisory System:**
- CAOS provides recommendations, not commands
- Crew retains authority for all decisions
- Transparency in AI reasoning
- Confidence levels displayed for all recommendations

**Automation Levels:**
- Level 1: Information only (fuel burn tracking)
- Level 2: Advisory (route optimization)
- Level 3: Auto-execute minor changes (<2 min, <50 kg)
- Level 4: Crew-initiated only (critical actions)

**Trust Calibration:**
- Historical accuracy metrics displayed
- Crew can rate recommendations
- System learns from crew decisions
- Appropriate trust level encouraged

## Emergency Operations Concept

**Emergency Response Philosophy:**
1. Fly the aircraft (maintain control)
2. Analyze situation (use CAOS assistance)
3. Take appropriate action (follow procedures)
4. Land as soon as practical/possible

**H₂ Emergency Procedures:**
- Immediate threat mitigation (memory items)
- Source identification and isolation
- Landing planning with CAOS assistance
- Coordination with ground emergency services

**CAOS Emergency Support:**
- Automatic emergency procedure display
- Landing site recommendations
- Performance calculations
- Emergency services coordination

## Training Concept

**Initial Type Rating:**
