**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-10-00-SAF-AEP  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Status:** Released

## Purpose

This document provides guidance for airport emergency planning specific to AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA operations. It addresses the unique considerations of hydrogen fuel and BWB configuration for airport emergency response planning.

## Regulatory Framework

### Applicable Standards

**ICAO Annex 14:**
- Aerodrome design and operations
- Rescue and fire fighting services
- Emergency planning requirements

**EASA CS-ADR-DSN:**
- Aerodrome certification
- Emergency procedures
- Rescue and fire fighting

**Local Requirements:**
- National CAA regulations

- Local fire service coordination

## Airport Categorization for AMPEL360

### Aircraft Category for RFF

**ICAO Category:** Category 9
- **Length:** 45m (BWB overall length)
- **Width:** 65m (BWB wingspan)
- **Fuselage Width:** 20m (maximum)

**RFF Requirements (Category 9):**
- Principal agent: 18,000 liters foam + 200 kg complementary
- Rescue vehicles: 3 minimum
- Response time: <3 minutes (2 minutes target)
- Personnel: 18 minimum (24 recommended for BWB)

### Special Requirements for H₂ Operations

1. Portable H₂ detectors (minimum 4)
2. Thermal imaging cameras (all vehicles)
3. Extended reach equipment (BWB width)
4. Additional water capacity (H₂ cooling)
5. Wind indicators (visible from command post)

**Personnel Training:**
- All RFF personnel: H₂ awareness (4 hours)
- RFF officers: Advanced H₂ training (8 hours)
- Annual refresher: H₂-specific (2 hours)
- AMPEL360 familiarization: All personnel

## H₂-Specific Emergency Planning

### Hazard Zones

**Hot Zone (50m radius):**
- Active H₂ leak or fire
- Entry: Essential personnel only
- PPE: Full turnout + SCBA
- Time limit: SCBA duration
- Upwind approach mandatory

**Warm Zone (50-100m):**
- Potential H₂ exposure
- Entry: Authorized personnel with H₂ training
- PPE: Minimum turnout gear
- Monitoring: Continuous H₂ detection

**Cold Zone (>100m):**
- Safe area for command, staging, triage
- Public access controlled
- Medical treatment area
- Incident command post

### Weather Considerations

**Wind:**
- **Critical Factor** for H₂ dispersion
- Continuous monitoring required
- Position resources upwind
- Evacuation routes account for wind
- Wind shift plans prepared

**Temperature:**
- Affects H₂ dispersion rate
- Cold weather: Increased visibility of vapor plume
- Hot weather: Faster dispersion

**Humidity:**
- Affects static electricity risk
- Dry conditions: Increased static risk
- Wet conditions: Improved bonding

**Lightning:**
- Suspend H₂ refueling if lightning within 5 nm
- Emergency response: Assess ignition risk
- H₂ detection before approach

## Refueling Emergency Procedures

### H₂ Refueling Safety

**Normal Operations:**
- 50m exclusion zone enforced
- Barricades and signage
- Fire equipment positioned
- Continuous H₂ monitoring
- No passengers aboard
- Engine/APU off
- Bonding verified <3 milliohm

**Emergency During Refueling:**

**Level 1 - H₂ Leak Detected (<10% LEL):**
1. Suspend refueling (do not disconnect)
2. Investigate source
3. Ventilate area
4. Monitor concentration
5. If concentration decreases, assess options
6. If concentration increases → Level 2

**Level 2 - Significant Leak (10-25% LEL):**
1. Emergency refueling shutdown
2. Notify airport fire service
3. Evacuate 50m zone (non-essential)
4. Position fire equipment upwind
5. Monitor continuously
6. Prepare for fire response

**Level 3 - Critical Leak (>25% LEL) or Fire:**
1. Emergency shutdown (all systems)
2. Activate airport emergency plan
3. Full fire service response
4. Evacuate 100m zone
5. Establish incident command
6. H₂ specialist to scene

### Refueling Equipment Emergency

**Refueler Vehicle Incident:**
- Treat as H₂ leak (above procedures)
- Do not move vehicle if leaking
- Isolate H₂ supply if possible
- Cool with water (upwind application)
- Large safety zone (vehicle capacity: typically 4,000 kg H₂)

## Aircraft Emergency Response

### Ground Emergency (Aircraft on Ground)

1. **Alert:** ATC notifies fire service
2. **Response:** 3 vehicles, upwind approach
3. **Assessment:** Thermal imaging for H₂ fire
4. **Action:**

   - H₂ fire: Cooling strategy, let burn if safe
   - Mixed: Prioritize life safety, cooling
5. **Evacuation:** Support passenger evacuation
6. **Accountability:** Verify all persons safe

**H₂ Leak (No Fire):**
1. **Alert:** Aircraft crew notifies ATC
2. **Response:** Fire service, upwind staging
3. **Assessment:** H₂ concentration measurement
4. **Zone:** 50m exclusion if >10% LEL
5. **Passengers:** Evacuate upwind
6. **Monitoring:** Continuous until safe
7. **Clearance:** <10% LEL before normal ops resume

**Emergency Evacuation (No Fire/Leak):**
1. **Alert:** Per standard airport plan
2. **Response:** Fire service + airport operations
3. **Slides:** Position personnel at slide base
4. **Crowd Control:** Direct passengers to assembly point
5. **Assistance:** Mobility-impaired passengers
6. **Medical:** Triage and treatment
7. **Accountability:** Coordinate with crew

### In-Flight Emergency (Aircraft Inbound)

**Full Emergency (Pan-Pan or Mayday):**

**Pre-Arrival Actions:**
1. **Alert Level:** Full emergency declared
2. **Fire Service:** All vehicles staged, upwind of likely landing area
