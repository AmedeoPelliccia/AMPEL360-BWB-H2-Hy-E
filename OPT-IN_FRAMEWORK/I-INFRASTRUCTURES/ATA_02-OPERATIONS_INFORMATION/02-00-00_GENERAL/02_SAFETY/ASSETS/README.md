# Safety Documentation Assets

This directory contains visual and supplementary assets for the Operations Safety documentation.

## Contents

### Safety Architecture Diagram (Safety_Architecture_Diagram.svg)
Visual representation of the multi-layer safety architecture showing the defense-in-depth approach for AMPEL360 operations.

**Elements:**
- Layer 1: Inherent Design Safety
- Layer 2: Operational Procedures
- Layer 3: Crew Competency
- Layer 4: Operational Monitoring
- Layer 5: Safety Barriers
- Layer 6: Emergency Response
- Layer 7: Investigation & Learning

### H2 Safety Zones (H2_Safety_Zones.pdf)

- Refueling safety zones (50m radius)
- Exclusion zones during H2 operations
- Emergency response zones
- Personnel protection areas
- Fire equipment positioning

### Emergency Response Flowcharts (Emergency_Response_Flowcharts.pdf)
Step-by-step flowcharts for emergency response procedures:
- H2 leak response (ground and flight)
- H2 fire response (ground and flight)
- Fuel cell emergency response
- Evacuation procedures
- Coordination with external services

### Safety Decision Trees (Safety_Decision_Trees.pdf)
Decision support trees for safety-critical decisions:
- Emergency severity assessment
- Diversion decision making
- Evacuation go/no-go decisions
- CAOS override decision logic
- Risk acceptance decisions

### Human Factors Analysis (Human_Factors_Analysis.pdf)
Human factors analysis and guidance:

## File Formats

- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics for diagrams (editable, high quality at any resolution)
- **PDF**: Portable document format for detailed documents and complex flowcharts

## Usage

These assets support the safety documentation and training materials. They should be:
- Reviewed during safety training
- Referenced in emergency procedures
- Used in safety briefings
- Updated when procedures change
- Version controlled with documentation

## Document Control

All assets in this directory are subject to the same document control as the parent safety documentation:
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-11-04
- **Owner**: Head of Safety
- **Classification**: Safety Critical - Unclassified

## Future Assets

Additional assets to be developed:
- H2 system operational schematics
- Fuel cell safety systems diagrams
- BWB evacuation route maps
- CAOS safety monitor architecture
- Training video thumbnails and links
- Interactive safety scenarios
