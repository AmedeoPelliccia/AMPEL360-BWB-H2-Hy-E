Human factors analysis and operational guidance:
- Workload assessment by flight phase
- Fatigue risk factors and indicators
- CRM principles application
- Automation interaction with CAOS
- Error prevention and detection strategies
- Stress management techniques
- BWB-specific human factors
- H2 system interaction considerations

### SMS Framework Diagram ([SMS_Framework_Diagram.svg](SMS_Framework_Diagram.svg))
Visual representation of the Safety Management System structure:

## Usage

These assets support the safety documentation and training materials. They should be:
- Reviewed during safety training
- Referenced in emergency procedures
- Used in safety briefings
- Updated when procedures change
- Version controlled with documentation

## Document Control

All assets in this directory are subject to the same document control as the parent safety documentation:
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-11-04
- **Owner**: Head of Safety
- **Classification**: Safety Critical - Unclassified

---

**Note**: All assets are now in markdown format with comprehensive content and hyperlinked cross-references per user request. This enables better navigation, version control, and collaborative editing.
