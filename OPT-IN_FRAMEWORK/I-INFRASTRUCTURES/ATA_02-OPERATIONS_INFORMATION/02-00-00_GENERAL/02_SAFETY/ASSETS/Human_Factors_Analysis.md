## 3. CRM PRINCIPLES APPLICATION

### 3.1 Communication (Inquiry-Advocacy-Assertion)

**Inquiry:** Ask questions to understand
- "What's your assessment of the H2 leak level?"
- "Help me understand why CAOS is recommending this route?"

**Advocacy:** State your position clearly
- "I recommend we divert to ALTERNATE due to fuel cell degradation."
- "I believe we should evacuate based on the fire indications."

**Assertion:** Speak up if safety concern
- "I'm not comfortable with that approach; weather is below our minimums."
- "STOP - I need to verify this before we proceed."

**BWB-CAOS Specific:**
- Clear communication of CG status
- CAOS recommendations discussed before implementation
- H2 system status verbalized
- Tail strike risk called out

### 3.2 Teamwork and Task Distribution

**Pilot Flying (PF) Primary Tasks:**
- Aircraft control (manual or monitoring automation)
- Flight path management
- Configuration changes
- Calls for checklists
- Final decision authority

**Pilot Monitoring (PM) Primary Tasks:**
- Radio communications (ATC)
- Checklist execution
- System monitoring (EICAS, CAOS)
- Navigation monitoring
- Performance calculations

**Dynamic Reallocation:**
- Workload sharing when one crew member saturated
- "I have the radios, you fly" or vice versa
- Clear verbal handoffs
- Monitor for task overload in partner

### 3.3 Decision-Making (FOR-DEC Model)

**F - Facts:** What do we know for certain?
- H2 leak detected, currently 3% LEL
- Fuel cell #2 is offline
- 450 nm from destination, 200 nm from alternate

**O - Options:** What can we do?
1. Continue to destination with monitoring
2. Divert to nearest alternate
3. Return to departure airport

**R - Risks & Benefits:** Evaluate each option
| Option | Benefits | Risks |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Continue | Destination facilities | Leak may worsen, longer flight |
| Divert | Shorter flight, less risk time | Unfamiliar airport, less support |
| Return | Known airport, company support | Overweight landing, longer in air |

**D - Decide:** Choose best option based on analysis
- Decision: Divert to alternate (best risk/benefit)

**E - Execute:** Implement the decision
- Declare emergency to ATC
- Brief cabin crew
- Execute diversion checklist
- Notify company

**C - Check:** Monitor outcome
- Is leak stable or worsening?
- Is plan working as expected?
- Adjust if needed

**CAOS Role:** Provides data for Facts, suggests Options, assesses Risks - but crew Decides.

### 3.4 Situational Awareness

**Three Levels of SA:**

**Level 1 - Perception:** What's happening?
- Monitoring displays, alerts, outside view
- Current aircraft state, systems status
- Immediate environment (weather, traffic)

**Level 2 - Comprehension:** What does it mean?
- Understanding significance of information
- Integrating multiple data sources
- Recognizing patterns or trends

**Level 3 - Projection:** What will happen next?
- Anticipating future states
- Planning ahead
- Predicting outcomes of actions

**SA Loss Indicators:**
- Confusion about aircraft state
- Surprise by events
- Fixation on one instrument/problem
- Loss of "big picture"

**SA Enhancement Strategies:**
- Regular "SA checks" ("Where are we? What's our plan?")
- Verbalize observations and intentions
- Cross-check between crew
- Use of CAOS for trend projection
- Avoid tunnel vision (scan widely)

## 4. AUTOMATION INTERACTION (CAOS)

### 4.1 Appropriate Trust in CAOS

**Trust Calibration Matrix:**

| CAOS Reliability | Crew Trust Level | Behavior |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Consistently accurate (95%+) | Appropriate | Use with monitoring |
| Mostly accurate (85-95%) | Slightly cautious | Verify critical items |
| Sometimes inaccurate (<85%) | Low trust | Manual primary, CAOS advisory |
| Untested domain | Very low trust | Manual only, learn from CAOS |

**Over-Trust Indicators:**
- Accepting recommendations without review
- Not monitoring CAOS actions
- Surprise when CAOS makes error
- Inability to operate without CAOS

**Under-Trust Indicators:**
- Rejecting all CAOS recommendations
- Not using CAOS capabilities
- Excessive manual workload
- Ignoring CAOS alerts

**Calibration Strategies:**
- Training on CAOS capabilities AND limitations
- Experience with CAOS performance
- Regular manual flying (maintain proficiency)
- Understand CAOS confidence levels
- Review CAOS recommendations with crew

### 4.2 Mode Awareness

**CAOS Modes:**
- **FULL**: All systems operational, full advisory
- **DEGRADED**: Some systems unavailable, limited advisory
- **MONITORING ONLY**: CAOS monitors but no recommendations
- **OFFLINE**: Manual operations only

**Mode Confusion Prevention:**
- Clear, prominent mode indication on EICAS
- CAOS narrates actions ("I am recommending X because Y")
- Mode changes announced to crew
- Training emphasizes mode awareness
- No automatic mode changes without crew alert

**Mode Transition Triggers:**
- System failures (auto-transition to degraded/offline)
- Crew selection (manual mode change)
- Flight phase (some functions limited in takeoff/landing)
- Abnormal situations (may revert to manual)

### 4.3 Override Decision Criteria

**When to Override CAOS:**
1. **Safety Concern**: Recommendation seems unsafe
2. **Better Information**: Crew has information CAOS lacks
3. **Low Confidence**: CAOS confidence level <70%
4. **Regulatory**: Recommendation violates regulation
5. **Procedure**: Conflicts with company procedures
6. **Intuition**: "It doesn't feel right" (investigate, then decide)

**Override Procedure:**
- Single-action override capability
- CAOS acknowledges override
- Manual action takes precedence
- Event logged for review
- No negative consequences for appropriate override

**Reference:** [CAOS_Safety_Integration.md Section 2](../CAOS_Safety_Integration.md#2-human-ai-collaboration-safety)

### 4.4 Manual Skills Maintenance
