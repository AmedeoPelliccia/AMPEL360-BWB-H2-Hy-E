## 2. SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEMS

### 2.1 Mandatory Reporting

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Accidents and serious incidents (immediate)
- Specific occurrences per regulations
- Reported to authority within specified time
- Follow-up investigation as required

**Reportable Occurrences:**
- Accidents (any occurrence resulting in death, injury, or aircraft damage)
- Serious incidents (per ICAO Annex 13 definition)
- H2 safety events (leaks, fires, pressure exceedances)
- Fuel cell failures affecting flight
- CAOS safety-critical malfunctions
- Flight control malfunctions
- Emergency evacuations

### 2.2 Voluntary Reporting

**Internal Safety Reporting System:**
- Open to all employees
- Confidential (reporter identity protected)
- Anonymous option available
- Non-punitive (just culture)
- Feedback to reporter
- Action tracking

**Reportable Items:**
- Hazards observed
- Near-misses
- Procedural issues
- Equipment problems
- Training concerns
- Safety suggestions
- Anything affecting safety

**Reporting Channels:**
- Online safety reporting portal
- Paper safety report form
- Safety hotline (24/7)
- Direct to safety department
- Through management

### 2.3 Just Culture

**Principles:**
- Errors are learning opportunities
- Honest mistakes not punished
- Accountability for willful violations
- System improvements, not blame
- Confidentiality protected

**Unacceptable Behavior:**
- Willful violation of procedures
- Reckless behavior
- Substance abuse
- Criminal activity
- These may result in disciplinary action

## 3. INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES

### 3.1 Investigation Objectives

**Purpose:**
- Determine what happened
- Identify contributing factors
- Identify root causes
- Prevent recurrence
- Share lessons learned
- NOT to assign blame or liability

### 3.2 Investigation Process

**Phase 1: Notification and Initial Response**
1. Incident notification received
2. Initial assessment
3. Classify severity
4. Appoint investigation team
5. Secure evidence
6. Notify authorities (if required)

**Phase 2: Data Collection**
1. Physical evidence
2. Flight data (FDR, CAOS logs)
3. Voice recordings (CVR, ATC)
4. Witness statements
5. Documentation
6. Environmental data

**Phase 3: Analysis**
1. Sequence of events
2. Contributing factors
3. Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
4. System failures vs. human errors
5. Organizational factors
6. Barrier analysis

**Phase 4: Recommendations**
1. Immediate safety actions
2. Short-term corrective actions
3. Long-term improvements
4. Responsibility assignment
5. Implementation timeline

**Phase 5: Report and Communication**
1. Investigation report
2. Distribute lessons learned
3. Implement recommendations
4. Track corrective actions
5. Verify effectiveness

### 3.3 Root Cause Analysis Methods

**5 Whys:**
- Ask "Why?" five times to get to root cause
- Simple, effective for straightforward issues

**Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram:**
- Categories: People, Procedures, Equipment, Environment, Organization
- Visual representation of causes

**Swiss Cheese Model:**
- Multiple barriers
- Holes align = incident occurs
- Strengthening barriers

## 4. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

### 4.1 Action Classification

**Immediate Safety Actions:**
- Prevent recurrence immediately
- Implemented within 24 hours
- May be interim measures
- Fleet-wide if applicable

**Corrective Actions:**
- Address identified causes
- Implementation as soon as practical
- May require design, procedure, training changes
- Tracked to completion

**Preventive Actions:**
- Prevent similar events
- Broader application
- System improvements

### 4.2 Action Tracking

**CAPA System (Corrective and Preventive Action):**
- Action assignment
- Target completion date
- Status tracking
- Effectiveness verification
- Closure approval

## 5. LESSONS LEARNED

### 5.1 Internal Lessons

**Process:**
1. Investigate occurrence
2. Identify lessons
3. Develop recommendations
4. Communicate fleet-wide
5. Implement changes
6. Verify effectiveness

**Communication:**
- Safety bulletin (critical)
