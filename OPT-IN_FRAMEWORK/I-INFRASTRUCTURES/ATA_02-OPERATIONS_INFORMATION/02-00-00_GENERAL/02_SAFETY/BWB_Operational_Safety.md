## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose

This document establishes safety requirements and procedures specific to the Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration of the AMPEL360 aircraft, addressing the unique operational characteristics and safety considerations of this innovative design.

### 1.2 BWB Configuration Overview

The BWB configuration integrates the wing and fuselage into a single lifting surface, creating operational characteristics distinct from conventional tube-and-wing aircraft:

**Key Features:**
- Wide-body integrated design
- Distributed passenger seating across wingspan
- Center-body structure houses passengers and systems
- Outboard sections primarily aerodynamic
- Wide center of gravity (CG) range
- Non-conventional control surface arrangement

## 2. BWB UNIQUE SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

### 2.1 Handling Characteristics

**Pitch Control:**
- Elevon control surfaces (combined elevator/aileron)
- Pitch-up tendency at high angles of attack
- Stall characteristics differ from conventional aircraft
- Pitch damping less than conventional designs

**Roll Control:**
- Wide-span differential elevon control
- Roll inertia higher than conventional aircraft
- Dutch roll characteristics
- Spiral stability considerations

**Yaw Control:**
- Winglet rudders (multiple surfaces)
- Yaw damper critical for passenger comfort
- Directional stability in crosswinds
- Adverse yaw characteristics

### 2.2 Weight and Balance Safety

**CG Range:**
- Wide CG envelope (20% MAC typical)
- Load distribution critical
- Fuel distribution affects CG significantly
- H2 fuel consumption CG shift considerations

**Loading Safety:**
- CAOS-integrated load planning mandatory
- Real-time CG monitoring during loading
- Maximum CG rate of change limits
- Ballast requirements rare but possible

### 2.3 Ground Operations Safety

**Ground Clearance:**
- Wing tip clearance during taxi
- Tail strike during takeoff/landing more sensitive
- Ground maneuvering requires careful monitoring
- Special considerations for contaminated runways

**Ground Handling:**
- Towing procedures unique to BWB
- Pushback clearances different
- Ground equipment positioning critical
- Wing walker requirements during ground movement

### 2.4 Emergency Evacuation

**Evacuation Challenges:**
- Wider cabin cross-section
- Greater distance to exits for some passengers
- Multiple evacuation levels possible
- Exit distribution optimized for BWB geometry

**Evacuation Performance:**
- Target: 90-second evacuation (50% exits)
- Demonstrated in certification testing
- Crew positioning critical
- Passenger briefing emphasizes nearest exit

## 3. OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

### 3.1 Normal Operations

**Takeoff:**
- Rotation rate controlled (tail strike prevention)
- Pitch attitude limits strictly observed
- CG verified before takeoff
- Wing tip clearance monitoring

**Cruise:**
- Trim management for efficiency
- CG management with fuel consumption
- Stability augmentation system monitoring
- Passenger comfort (ride quality) monitoring

**Landing:**
- Approach speed management (pitch sensitivity)
- Touchdown target zone critical (tail strike)
- Crosswind limitations observed
- Go-around decision altitude strictly enforced

### 3.2 Abnormal Procedures

**Flight Control Degradation:**
- Redundant flight control systems
- Degraded handling qualities procedures
- Speed and configuration limitations
- Approach and landing considerations

**CG Out of Limits:**
- Immediate assessment of controllability
- Ballast or fuel transfer if available
- Landing considerations (speed, technique)
- Declare emergency if necessary

### 3.3 Emergency Procedures

**Loss of Stability Augmentation:**
- Manual flying qualities degraded
- Speed restrictions apply
- Increased crew workload
- Approach and landing technique modified

**Evacuation:**
- Crew commands optimized for BWB geometry
- Multiple evacuation routes emphasized
- Assistance for mobility-impaired passengers
- Accountability procedures
