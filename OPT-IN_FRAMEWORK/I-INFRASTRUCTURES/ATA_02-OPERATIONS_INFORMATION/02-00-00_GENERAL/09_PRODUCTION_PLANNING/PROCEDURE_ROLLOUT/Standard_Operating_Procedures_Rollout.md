## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Crew resistance to new procedures | Medium | Strong change management, pilot involvement |
| CAOS procedure complexity | Medium | Simplified initial SOPs, progressive complexity |
| SOP-reality mismatch | High | Extensive validation, rapid feedback loops |
| Regulatory non-compliance | High | Early authority engagement, compliance reviews |

## Success Metrics
- 100% crew trained on SOPs before operations
- <5% SOP deviations in first month
- >4.0/5.0 crew satisfaction with SOPs
- Zero safety events due to SOP inadequacy
- Regulatory acceptance

## Deliverables
