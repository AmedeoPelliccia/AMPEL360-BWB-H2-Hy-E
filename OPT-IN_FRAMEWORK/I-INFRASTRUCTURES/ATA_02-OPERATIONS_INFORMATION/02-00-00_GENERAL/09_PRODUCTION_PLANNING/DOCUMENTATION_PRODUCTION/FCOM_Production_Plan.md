## Production Schedule
| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Content outline complete | 2025-12-15 | Planning |
| Volume 1 draft | 2026-02-15 | Planning |
| Volume 2 draft | 2026-03-31 | Planning |
| Volume 3 draft | 2026-04-30 | Planning |
| Volume 4 draft | 2026-05-15 | Planning |

## Dependencies
- **AFM_Complete**: Base limitations and performance data
- **Systems_Description**: Detailed system operation data
- **Flight_Test_Results**: Validated procedures
- **CAOS_Interface**: System integration documentation
- **Type_Rating_Course**: Training alignment

## Resources Required
- Technical Writer 1 (100% allocation)
- Technical Writer 2 (100% allocation)
- Operations SME (60% allocation)
- Flight Test Pilot (30% allocation)
- CAOS Integration Specialist (40% allocation)
- Technical Illustrator (80% allocation)

## Quality Assurance
- Pilot review and validation
- Flight simulator validation
- Cross-reference verification with AFM
- CAOS integration testing
- Format and style compliance
- Regulatory review

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AFM completion delays | High | Early coordination, parallel development |
| CAOS feature changes | Medium | Regular software team syncs |
| Pilot SME availability | Medium | Multiple pilot reviewers |
| BWB handling characteristics | High | Simulator validation, flight test data |

## Special Considerations
- **BWB Configuration**: Unique handling characteristics require specialized procedures
- **H₂ Operations**: Novel fuel system procedures require extensive validation
- **CAOS Integration**: AI-assisted operations require new procedural framework
- **Digital-First**: EFB optimization prioritized over paper format

## Deliverables
- FCOM Master Document (4 volumes, PDF and S1000D)
- Digital version for EFB (interactive)
- Quick Reference Handbook integration
- CAOS-integrated procedures
- Printed copies for aircraft library
- Translation source files
