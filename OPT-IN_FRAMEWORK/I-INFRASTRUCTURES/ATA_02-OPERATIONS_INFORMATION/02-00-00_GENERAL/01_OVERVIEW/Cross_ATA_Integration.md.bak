## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how ATA 02 (Operations Information) integrates with other ATA chapters for the AMPEL360 BWB H2 Hy-E Q100 INTEGRA aircraft, ensuring seamless operational information flow across all technical documentation.

**Note:** All ATA 02 references now use the new origin block paths (e.g., `02-20-00_SYSTEMS/02-20-XX` instead of `02-XX-00`).
