## Flight Crew Factors

### Cockpit Design

**Ergonomics:**
- Seating positions optimized for BWB visibility
- Control accessibility within reach envelopes
- Display viewing angles optimized
- Lighting adaptable to all conditions

**Visibility:**
- BWB nose configuration provides excellent forward visibility
- Side window design for taxiing
- Camera systems augment blind spots
- HUD integration for low visibility operations

### Workload Management

**Normal Operations:**
- CAOS automation reduces routine workload
- Intuitive interface design
- Clear mode awareness
- Standardized procedures

**Abnormal/Emergency:**
- CAOS decision support
- Prioritized alerting system
- Quick reference guides
- Simplified checklists

---

## Crew-CAOS Interaction

### Human-AI Collaboration

**Authority Model:**
- Human has final authority
- CAOS provides advisory support
- Clear indication of automation state
- Easy override capability

**Trust Development:**
- Transparent AI reasoning
- Confidence indicators
- Explanation capability
- Consistent behavior

### Training Requirements

**Initial Training:**
- CAOS system familiarization: 8 hours
- Human factors awareness: 4 hours
- Automation management: 4 hours
- Emergency override procedures: 2 hours

---

## Cabin Crew Factors

### BWB Cabin Challenges

**Spatial Awareness:**
- Non-traditional cabin layout
- Multiple zones across width
- Training for emergency navigation
- Passenger assistance procedures

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Evacuation coordination
- Multiple exit management
- H₂ safety awareness
- BWB-specific scenarios

---

## Passenger Experience

### Comfort Factors

**Cabin Environment:**
- Noise level: 65 dB (75% quieter than conventional)
- Vibration: Reduced due to BWB structure
- Pressurization: Standard 8,000 ft cabin altitude
- Air quality: Enhanced with H₂ water byproduct

**Seating:**
- Standard seat pitch: 30-32 inches
- Seat width: 18 inches
- No "center seat" disadvantage in many rows
- Better overhead storage distribution

### Accessibility

**Passenger Accommodation:**
- Wheelchair accessibility
- Reduced mobility assistance
- Service animal accommodation
- Medical equipment power

---

## Maintenance Personnel Factors

### Maintainability

**Access Design:**
- Tool clearance considered
- Component reach envelopes
- Visual inspection capability
- Test point accessibility

**Safety:**
- H₂ system safety training
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Lockout/tagout procedures
- CAOS maintenance support

---

## Human Error Prevention

### Error-Tolerant Design

**Principles:**
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Confirmation for critical actions
- Reversible actions where possible
- Error recovery procedures

**CAOS Support:**
- Anomaly detection
- Procedure verification
- Performance monitoring
- Error alerting
