% MATLAB/Simulink Model: H2 Refueling Process
% File: SIM-02-00-101_Refueling_Process.slx
% Purpose: Simulation of liquid hydrogen refueling process
%
% This is a placeholder for the actual Simulink model file.
%
% Model Components:
% - Cryogenic transfer line model
% - Tank pressure/temperature dynamics
% - Fill rate control system
% - Safety interlocks
% - Boil-off during refueling
%
% Simulated Procedures:
% - Pre-cooling sequence
% - Tank filling (sequential and simultaneous)
% - Pressure stabilization
% - Post-fill procedures
%
% Outputs:
% - Refueling time estimates
% - Boil-off losses
% - Safety margin verification
% - Procedure optimization
