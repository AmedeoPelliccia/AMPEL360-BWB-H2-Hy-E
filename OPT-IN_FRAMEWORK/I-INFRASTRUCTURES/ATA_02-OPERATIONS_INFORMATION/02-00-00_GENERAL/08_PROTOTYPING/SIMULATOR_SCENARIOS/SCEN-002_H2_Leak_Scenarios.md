# SCEN-002 - H2 Leak Scenarios v2.0

**Scenario ID:** SCEN-002  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-03  
**Status:** Complete  
**Complexity:** High

## Scenario Set Overview
Comprehensive H₂ leak detection and response scenarios with enhanced emergency procedures.

## Scenario 2.1: Minor H₂ Leak in Cruise

**Flight Profile:**
- Phase: Cruise at FL350
- Time into flight: 1:15
- Location: 200 NM from destination

**Initial Conditions:**
- Normal operations
- Both fuel cells operating normally
- H₂ tank pressure: 580 bar (normal)

**Event Trigger:**
- H₂ leak detection warning (Minor leak - 0.5% loss rate)
- CAOS advisory: "H₂ leak detected in distribution line"
- Tank pressure slowly decreasing

**Required Actions:**
1. Identify leak location (CAOS display)
2. Execute H₂ leak checklist
3. Close isolation valves as required
4. Monitor leak progression
5. Plan landing at destination or divert

**Training Objectives:**
- Leak detection recognition
- Proper checklist usage
- CAOS diagnostic interpretation
- Decision making (continue vs. divert)
- Crew coordination

**Success Criteria:**
- Leak identified within 30 seconds
- Checklist executed correctly
- Safe landing accomplished
- Proper ATC communication

**Variations:**
- Leak stops after valve closure
- Leak continues despite isolation
- Multiple divert options available

## Scenario 2.2: Major H₂ Leak on Ground (Refueling)

**Phase:** Ground operations during refueling
**Location:** Gate / refueling station

**Initial Conditions:**
- H₂ refueling in progress
- 60% tank capacity reached
- Ground crew performing refueling

**Event Trigger:**
- Major leak at refueling connection
- H₂ gas cloud visible (simulated)
- Multiple warnings

**Required Actions:**
1. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN
2. Evacuate area immediately
3. Alert fire services
4. Establish exclusion zone (100m)
5. Monitor from safe distance
6. Coordinate emergency response

**Training Objectives:**
- Ground emergency recognition
- Emergency shutdown procedure
- Evacuation coordination
- Emergency services communication
- Safety zone establishment

**Success Criteria:**
- Immediate shutdown (<5 seconds)
- Proper evacuation
- Fire services alerted
- No personnel injuries

## Scenario 2.3: H₂ Leak with Fire Warning

**Flight Profile:**
- Phase: Climb at 8,000 ft
- Just after takeoff (5 minutes)

**Initial Conditions:**
- Normal climb operations
- High power setting on fuel cells

**Event Trigger:**
- H₂ leak warning
- Fire warning in fuel cell bay
- Rapid pressure loss

**Required Actions:**
1. H₂ MAIN VALVE - CLOSE (memory item)
2. FUEL CELL SHUTDOWN - EXECUTE
3. FIRE EXTINGUISHER - ACTIVATE
4. BATTERY MODE - ENGAGE
5. EMERGENCY RETURN - INITIATE
6. DECLARE MAYDAY

**Training Objectives:**
- Memory item execution
- Multiple emergency management
- Emergency return procedures
- High workload management
- Crew resource management

**Success Criteria:**
- Memory items within 10 seconds
- Fire extinguished
- Safe emergency landing
- Proper prioritization

## Scenario 2.4: Slow H₂ Leak - Long Duration

**Flight Profile:**
- Phase: Cruise
- Duration: 2+ hours remaining
- Very slow leak (0.1% per hour)

**Initial Conditions:**
- Normal cruise operations
- H₂ quantity slowly decreasing

**Event Trigger:**
- CAOS predictive warning: "Abnormal H₂ consumption detected"
- Subtle pressure decrease
- No immediate danger

**Required Actions:**
1. Verify CAOS advisory
2. Monitor H₂ system closely
3. Calculate remaining endurance
4. Plan diversion if necessary
5. Inform company and ATC
6. Prepare for potential escalation

**Training Objectives:**
- Subtle problem recognition
- CAOS predictive advisory usage
- Long-term planning
- Fuel endurance calculation
- Risk assessment

**Success Criteria:**
- Problem identified early
- Appropriate action plan
- Safe landing before fuel critical
- Good crew coordination

## Scenario 2.5: H₂ Overpressure with Leak

**Flight Profile:**
- Phase: Descent
- Temperature increasing rapidly

**Initial Conditions:**
- Descent from cruise
- H₂ tank warming

**Event Trigger:**
- Tank overpressure warning
- Relief valve opens
- H₂ venting (controlled leak)

**Required Actions:**
1. Monitor relief valve operation
2. Verify venting is controlled
3. Reduce H₂ flow rate
4. Monitor tank pressure trend
5. Land at nearest suitable airport
6. Brief cabin crew and passengers

**Training Objectives:**
- Understand relief valve operation
- Distinguish controlled vs uncontrolled leak
- Pressure management
- Precautionary landing decision

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct system understanding
- Appropriate response
- Safe precautionary landing
- Passenger briefing completed
