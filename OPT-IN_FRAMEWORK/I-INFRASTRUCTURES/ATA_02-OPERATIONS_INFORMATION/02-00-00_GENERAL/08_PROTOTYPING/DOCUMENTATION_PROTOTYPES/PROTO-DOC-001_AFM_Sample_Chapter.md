- MMO (Maximum Operating Mach): 0.82

**Minimum Speed:**
- VS1 (Stalling Speed, Landing Configuration): 95 KIAS
- VS (Stalling Speed, Clean Configuration): 110 KIAS

**Flap Extended Speeds:**
- Flaps 1: 230 KIAS
- Flaps 2: 200 KIAS
- Flaps 3: 180 KIAS
- Flaps Full: 160 KIAS

**Landing Gear:**

- VLE (Landing Gear Extended Speed): 270 KIAS

### 1.3 WEIGHT LIMITATIONS

**Maximum Weights:**
- MTOW (Maximum Takeoff Weight): 110,000 kg
- MLW (Maximum Landing Weight): 100,000 kg
- MZFW (Maximum Zero Fuel Weight): 95,000 kg

**Minimum Operating Weight:** 85,000 kg (Basic Empty Weight)

### 1.4 CENTER OF GRAVITY LIMITATIONS

**CG Range (% MAC):**
- Forward Limit: 42.0% MAC
- Aft Limit: 48.0% MAC

**BWB-Specific Note:** The blended wing body configuration has a wider acceptable CG range compared to conventional aircraft. However, limits must still be strictly observed for safety.

### 1.5 HYDROGEN FUEL SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

**H₂ Tank Pressure:**
- Maximum Tank Pressure: 700 bar
- Minimum Operating Pressure: 350 bar
- Relief Valve Setting: 750 bar

**H₂ Tank Temperature:**
- Normal Operating Range: -253°C to -250°C
- Maximum Temperature: -245°C (warning threshold)

**H₂ Fuel Capacity:**
- Maximum Fuel Capacity: 3,500 kg
- Minimum Fuel for Flight: 200 kg + reserves

**Refueling Limitations:**
- Maximum Fill Rate: 100 kg/min
- Maximum Ambient Temperature for Refueling: 35°C
- Minimum Clearance from Ignition Sources: 50 meters
- No passengers on board during refueling

### 1.6 FUEL CELL LIMITATIONS

**Fuel Cell Stack Temperature:**
- Normal Operating Range: 60-80°C
- Maximum Temperature: 90°C
- Minimum Starting Temperature: 40°C

**Fuel Cell Power Output:**
- Maximum Continuous Power (Both Stacks): 5.5 MW
- Maximum Single Stack Power: 3.0 MW
- Minimum Operating Power: 0.5 MW per stack

**Operating Time Limits:**
- No limitations on continuous operation within normal parameters
- Maximum time at peak power: 10 minutes

### 1.7 BATTERY LIMITATIONS

**Battery Temperature:**
- Normal Operating Range: 15-45°C
- Maximum Temperature: 55°C
- Minimum Temperature: 5°C

**State of Charge (SOC):**
- Maximum SOC: 95%
- Minimum SOC for Flight: 50%
- Emergency Reserve: 15% (30 minutes at essential load)

**Battery Emergency Mode:**
- Maximum Duration: 45 minutes (estimated)
- Essential systems only
- Immediate landing required

### 1.8 ALTITUDE LIMITATIONS

**Maximum Operating Altitude:**
- Service Ceiling: 41,000 ft
- Maximum Certified Altitude: 43,000 ft

**Minimum Safe Altitude:**
- As per applicable regulations and terrain clearance

### 1.9 TEMPERATURE LIMITATIONS

**Outside Air Temperature:**
- Maximum Operating Temperature: ISA +35°C
- Minimum Operating Temperature: ISA -50°C

**Special Considerations:**
- H₂ system performance affected by extreme temperatures
- Fuel cell efficiency optimum at ISA to ISA +15°C

### 1.10 WIND LIMITATIONS

**Takeoff and Landing:**
- Maximum Headwind: 50 kt
- Maximum Tailwind: 15 kt
- Maximum Crosswind: 35 kt (dry runway)
- Maximum Crosswind: 20 kt (wet runway)

**BWB-Specific Note:** Wide fuselage configuration provides good crosswind handling characteristics.

### 1.11 MANEUVER LIMITATIONS

**Load Factors (Flaps Up):**
- Positive Limit: +2.5 g
- Negative Limit: -1.0 g

**Load Factors (Flaps Extended):**
- Positive Limit: +2.0 g
- Negative Limit: 0.0 g

**Bank Angle:**
- Maximum Bank Angle (Normal Operations): 30°
- Maximum Bank Angle (Steep Turns, Training): 45°

**Prohibited Maneuvers:**
- Intentional spins
- Aerobatic maneuvers
- Sustained inverted flight

### 1.12 CAOS SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

**CAOS Operation:**
- CAOS system is advisory only
- Pilot retains final authority
- CAOS unavailable does not preclude flight operations
- Manual procedures available for all flight phases

**CAOS Limitations:**
- Response latency: <100 ms (typical)
- Predictive accuracy: Not 100% (use pilot judgment)
- Weather prediction based on available data
- System requires minimum sensor availability

### 1.13 OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS
