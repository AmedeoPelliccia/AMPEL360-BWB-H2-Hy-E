# Anomaly Detection Models
## ML Models for Fleet-wide Anomaly Detection

**Model Format:** Keras/TensorFlow (.h5)  
**Architecture:** Autoencoder Neural Network

## Purpose
Detect anomalous behavior across fleet:
- Unusual performance patterns
- Unexpected system behavior
- Early failure indicators
- Operating practice deviations

## Training
- Trained on historical fleet data
- Continuously updated with new data
- Unsupervised learning approach
- Anomaly threshold: 3 standard deviations

## Deployment
- Cloud-based inference
- Real-time monitoring
- Alert generation
- Root cause analysis

**Note:** Placeholder for actual .h5 model files.
