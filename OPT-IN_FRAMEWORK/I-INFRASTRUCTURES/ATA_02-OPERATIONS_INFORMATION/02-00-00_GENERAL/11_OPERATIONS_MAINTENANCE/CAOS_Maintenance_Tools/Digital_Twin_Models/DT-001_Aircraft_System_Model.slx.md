# DT-001: Aircraft System Model
## Simulink Model for Complete Aircraft Digital Twin

**Model Type:** Multi-domain physics simulation  
**Update Rate:** Real-time (100 Hz)  
**File Format:** Simulink (.slx)

## Model Scope
- Complete aircraft dynamics (6DOF)
- Aerodynamic forces and moments
- Propulsion system (fuel cells)
- Flight control system
- Environmental interactions

## Inputs
- Control surface deflections
- Fuel cell power outputs
- Environmental conditions
- Weight and CG

## Outputs
- Aircraft state (position, velocity, attitude)
- Loads on structure
- System performance metrics
- Predictive alerts

## Implementation
This would be a comprehensive Simulink model with multiple subsystems.
For actual implementation, use MATLAB/Simulink R2023a or later.

**Note:** This is a placeholder. Actual .slx file would be binary format.
