# CAOS Predictive Tasks
## Condition-Based Maintenance Generated by AI

## Overview
CAOS system generates maintenance tasks based on:
- Real-time component health monitoring
- Predictive algorithms
- Fleet-wide learning
- Risk assessment

## Task Generation Criteria

### Yellow Advisory (Schedule Maintenance)
- Predicted failure >100 FH away
- Component health 85-92%
- Plan maintenance at next convenient opportunity

### Orange Caution (Prioritize Maintenance)
- Predicted failure 50-100 FH away
- Component health 80-85%
- Schedule within 7 days

### Red Warning (Immediate Action)
- Predicted failure <50 FH away
- Component health <80%
- Ground aircraft and address immediately

## Predictive Task Types

### PA-001: Fuel Cell Degradation
- Monitors voltage, current, temperature
- Predicts remaining useful life
- Generates overhaul tasks

### PA-002: H₂ System Health
- Monitors pressures, temperatures, leaks
- Predicts insulation/valve failures
- Generates inspection/replacement tasks

### PA-003: Structural Monitoring
- Monitors strain, acoustic emissions
- Predicts fatigue life
- Generates NDT inspection tasks

## Integration with Maintenance Planning
1. CAOS generates predictive task
2. Task routed to maintenance planning system
3. Scheduled based on priority and resources
4. Work order created
5. Task executed
6. Feedback to CAOS for model improvement

## Performance Tracking
- Prediction accuracy monitored
- False positive/negative rates tracked
- Models continuously improved
- Target accuracy: >85%
