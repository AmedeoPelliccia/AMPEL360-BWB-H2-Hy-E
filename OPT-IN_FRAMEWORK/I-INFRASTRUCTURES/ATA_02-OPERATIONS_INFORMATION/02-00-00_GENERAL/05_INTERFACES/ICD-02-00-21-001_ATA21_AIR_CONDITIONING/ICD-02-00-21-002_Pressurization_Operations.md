# ICD-02-00-21-002: Pressurization Operations
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Active

## Interface Description
Aircraft pressurization control integrated with H2 system safety management.

## Pressurization Considerations
- H2 compartments maintained at negative pressure relative to cabin
- Emergency depressurization considers H2 tank stress
- Leak isolation coordinated with pressurization system

## Normal Operations
- Cabin altitude: Sea level to 8,000 ft
- Differential pressure: Max 8.6 psi
- H2 compartment: -0.2 psi differential (negative)

**RQ-ICD-02-21-010:** H2 compartment negative pressure maintained  
**RQ-ICD-02-21-011:** Emergency depressurization coordinated with H2 system
