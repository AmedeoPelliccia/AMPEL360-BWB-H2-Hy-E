# ICD-02-00-EXT-041: Performance Database
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Active

## Interface Description
Aircraft performance database for flight planning and operations.

## Performance Data
- Takeoff performance (MTOW, runway, conditions)
- Climb performance (fuel cell power, weight, temperature)
- Cruise performance (altitude, speed, fuel burn)
- Descent performance (idle descent, speed schedules)
- Landing performance (MLW, runway, conditions)

## BWB-Specific Performance
- Blended wing body aerodynamics
- Wide CG envelope management
- Distributed lift characteristics
- Ground effect considerations

## Fuel Cell Performance
- Power-specific fuel consumption
- Efficiency curves (altitude, temperature)
- Degraded mode performance
- Emergency power profiles

**RQ-ICD-02-EXT-410:** Performance data accuracy ±5%  
**RQ-ICD-02-EXT-411:** Database update quarterly  
**RQ-ICD-02-EXT-412:** In-service performance tracking
