# [RQ-02-00-05-001](./RQ-02-00-05-001_*.md): H₂ Total Capacity 8000 kg

## Requirement Details

**ID:** [RQ-02-00-05-001](./RQ-02-00-05-001_*.md)  
**Category:** H2 Operations  
**Subcategory:** Capacity  
**Title:** H₂ Total Capacity 8000 kg  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Description

The aircraft hydrogen fuel system shall have a total storage capacity of 8000 kg of liquid hydrogen, providing sufficient fuel for the design range of 3500 NM with appropriate reserves.

## Rationale

The 8000 kg capacity is sized to meet:
- Design range: 3500 NM
- Cruise fuel burn: ~1900 kg/hr
- Flight time: ~4.5 hours
- Reserve fuel: 45 minutes hold + diversion
- Boil-off losses during ground operations

## Source

- **Document:** Design Specification DS-H2-FUEL-001
- **Section:** Tank Capacity Requirements
- **Date:** 2024-06-15

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Total tank volumetric capacity accommodates 8000 kg of liquid H₂ at -253°C
2. Tank structural capacity verified for full fuel load
3. CG envelope satisfied with full and empty tanks
4. Usable fuel meets minimum 7850 kg (98% usability)
5. Tank system weight within allocated mass budget

## Verification Method

**Method:** Inspection  
**Procedure:** TP-H2-CAP-001  
**Status:** Verified  
**Date:** 2025-08-15

## Traceability

- **Parent ATA:** 02-30-00 (Hydrogen Fuel Data)
- **Design Implementation:** [ATA 28-10-00](../../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENIC_SYSTEMS/ATA_28-FUEL_SAF_AND_CRYOGENIC/) H₂ Storage Tanks
- **Verification Doc:** VER-28-10-001
- **Validation Doc:** VAL-28-10-001

## Related Requirements

- [RQ-02-00-05-002](./RQ-02-00-05-002_*.md): H₂ Usable Fuel 7850 kg
- [RQ-02-00-03-001](../RQ-PERFORMANCE/RQ-02-00-03-001_*.md): Range 3500 NM
- [RQ-02-00-01-015](../RQ-REGULATORY/RQ-02-00-01-015_*.md): [ISO 19881](https://www.iso.org/standard/66482.html) Compliance
- [RQ-02-00-05-003](./RQ-02-00-05-003_*.md): H₂ Temperature -253°C
- [RQ-02-00-06-001](../RQ-BWB-OPERATIONS/RQ-02-00-06-001_*.md): CG Range 15-42% MAC

## Impact Areas

- Tank design and sizing
- Aircraft CG management
- Structural loads
- Range performance
- Refueling time
- Boil-off management

## Technical Details

**Liquid H₂ Properties:**
- Density: 70.8 kg/m³ at -253°C
- Required volume: ~113 m³
- Tank location: Distributed in BWB center body
- Tank configuration: Multiple interconnected tanks

**Mass Budget:**
- H₂ fuel: 8000 kg
- Tank structure: ~2400 kg (30% of fuel mass)
- Insulation: ~800 kg
- Total fuel system: ~11,200 kg

## Risks

- **Risk:** Boil-off reduces available fuel below required capacity
- **Mitigation:** Active cooling system, high-performance insulation, rapid turnaround procedures

- **Risk:** Tank volume exceeds available BWB internal space
- **Mitigation:** Distributed tank configuration, optimized tank shapes

## Notes

The 8000 kg capacity represents stored hydrogen only. Additional backup/emergency systems (batteries, APU) provide redundancy for critical systems.

Tank capacity includes 2% margin for boil-off during typical 2-hour ground operations (refueling, boarding, taxi).
