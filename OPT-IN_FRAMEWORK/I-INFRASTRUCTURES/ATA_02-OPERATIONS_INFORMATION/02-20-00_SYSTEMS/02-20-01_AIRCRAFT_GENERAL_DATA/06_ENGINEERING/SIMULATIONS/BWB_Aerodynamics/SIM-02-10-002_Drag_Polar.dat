# - Distributed lift reduces induced drag
# - Integrated body-wing reduces interference drag
# - Gentle pressure gradients minimize separation
# - Laminar flow potential on upper surface: 15-25%

# DRAG REDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES
# - Natural laminar flow regions on center body
# - Boundary layer ingestion consideration for propulsion
# - Winglets reduce induced drag by 8%
# - Smooth surface finish: Ra < 3.2 μm
# - Flush-mounted antennas and sensors
