# RQ-02-10-10-002: Ground Clearances

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-10-002  
**Category:** Dimensions  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft shall maintain minimum ground clearances to prevent damage during normal ground operations and maximum pitch/roll attitudes.

**Minimum Ground Clearances:**
- Aft fuselage (tail skid position): 450 mm (17.7 in)
- Wing tips: 800 mm (31.5 in)
- Engine nacelle bottom: 600 mm (23.6 in)
- Landing gear doors (extended): 150 mm (5.9 in)

**Critical Pitch Attitudes:**
- Takeoff rotation: 12.5° nose up
- Landing flare: 10.0° nose up
- Ground maneuvering: ±5.0°

## Rationale

Ground clearance requirements ensure:
- Safe ground operations on all certified surfaces
- Prevention of foreign object damage
- Accommodation of uneven taxiway surfaces
- Compliance with certification requirements
- Protection during maintenance operations

## Verification

- **Method:** Measurement and Analysis
- **Procedure:** Ground clearance measurement at critical attitudes
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Minimum clearances maintained at all critical attitudes
  - No contact with ground during rotation/landing
  - Clearance margins verified by ground tests
  - Compliance with CS-25.231

## Compliance

- CS-25.231: Longitudinal stability and control
- CS-25.233: Directional stability and control
- CS-25.237: Wind velocities
- CS-25.479: Level landing conditions
