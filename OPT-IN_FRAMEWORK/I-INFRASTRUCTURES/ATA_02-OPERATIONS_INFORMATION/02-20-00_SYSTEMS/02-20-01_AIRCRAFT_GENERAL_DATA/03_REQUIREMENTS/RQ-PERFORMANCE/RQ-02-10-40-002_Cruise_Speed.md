# RQ-02-10-40-002: Cruise Speed

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-40-002  
**Category:** Performance  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft shall achieve a cruise speed of Mach 0.78 at the optimum cruise altitude to balance fuel efficiency and competitive block times.

**Cruise Speed Performance:**
- **Long Range Cruise (LRC):** M0.78 / 450 KTAS at FL410
- **Maximum Cruise:** M0.82 / 472 KTAS at FL390
- **Economy Cruise:** M0.75 / 432 KTAS at FL430

**Cruise Altitude Range:** FL370 - FL450

## Performance Details

**At M0.78, FL410:**
- True Airspeed (TAS): 450 kt (833 km/h)
- Fuel Flow: 1,580 kg/h H₂
- Specific Range: 0.285 NM/kg
- L/D Ratio: 22.5 (BWB advantage)

## Rationale

Cruise speed selection ensures:
- Competitive block times vs. conventional aircraft
- Optimal fuel efficiency (best L/D near M0.78)
- Passenger satisfaction (similar to current narrowbodies)
- Air traffic management compatibility
- BWB aerodynamic efficiency utilization

## Comparative Block Times

| Route | AMPEL360 (M0.78) | A320 (M0.78) | Time Difference |
|-------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Paris-Dubai | 6h 15m | 6h 20m | -5 min |
| London-New York | 7h 30m | 7h 45m | -15 min |
| Frankfurt-Singapore | 12h 20m | 12h 45m | -25 min |

**Note:** Time savings from BWB efficiency and optimal cruise altitude

## Speed Limitations

**Maximum Operating Speed (VMO/MMO):**
- VMO: 350 KIAS
- MMO: M0.85
- Design Dive Speed: M0.90

**Operational Considerations:**
- Turbulence penetration: M0.75 / 280 KIAS
- Holding speed: 250 KIAS or M0.70

## Verification

- **Method:** Flight Test
- **Procedure:** Speed and fuel flow measurement at cruise conditions
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Achieves M0.78 at FL410 with required fuel flow
  - Meets drag predictions (±5%)
  - Controllability demonstrated up to MMO
  - Flutter-free throughout speed envelope

## CAOS Optimization

- Optimal cruise speed recommendation based on:
  - Wind conditions
  - Fuel remaining
  - Time constraints
  - Traffic flow
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Adaptive speed management

## Compliance

- CS-25.103: Stall speed
- CS-25.253: High-speed characteristics
- CS-25.335: Design airspeeds
- CS-25.1505: Maximum operating limit speed
