# RQ-02-10-20-002: MLW Specification

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-20-002  
**Category:** Weights  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft Maximum Landing Weight (MLW) shall not exceed 155,000 kg to ensure safe landing operations and structural integrity.

**MLW:** 155,000 kg (341,713 lb)  
**Typical Landing Weight:** 145,000 kg (319,670 lb)  
**Emergency Overweight Landing:** Permitted with inspection

## Rationale

MLW limit ensures:
- Landing gear structural capacity not exceeded
- Brake energy absorption within limits
- Wing and fuselage landing loads acceptable
- Go-around performance maintained
- Runway length requirements met
- Structural fatigue life maintained

## Operational Implications

**Normal Operations:**
- Standard landing weight: 145,000 kg
- Allows for 10,000 kg margin to MLW
- Fuel dumping not required for typical operations

**Emergency Overweight Landing:**
- Permitted up to MTOW (185,000 kg) in emergency
- Requires post-landing structural inspection
- Inspection procedure defined in AMM

## Verification

- **Method:** Analysis and Test
- **Procedure:** Landing gear drop tests and structural analysis
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Landing gear design loads verified at MLW
  - Brake energy absorption validated
  - Structural analysis demonstrates adequate margins
  - Flight test landing demonstrations completed

## Compliance

- CS-25.25: Weight limits
- CS-25.473: Ground load conditions
- CS-25.735: Brakes and braking systems
- CS-25.1581: General operating and flight information
