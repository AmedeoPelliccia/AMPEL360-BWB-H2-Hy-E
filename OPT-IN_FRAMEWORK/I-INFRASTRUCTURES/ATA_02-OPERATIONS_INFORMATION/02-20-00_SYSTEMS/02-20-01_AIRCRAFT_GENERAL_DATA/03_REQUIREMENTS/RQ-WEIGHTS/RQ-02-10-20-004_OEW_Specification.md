# RQ-02-10-20-004: OEW Specification

**Requirement ID:** RQ-02-10-20-004  
**Category:** Weights  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved

## Requirement

The aircraft Operating Empty Weight (OEW) shall not exceed 95,000 kg to ensure payload and fuel capacity targets are achievable within MTOW limits.

**OEW Target:** 95,000 kg (209,439 lb)  
**OEW Allowance:** ±2% (93,100 - 96,900 kg)  
**Growth Margin:** 3,000 kg allocated for future modifications

## OEW Composition

| Component Group | Weight (kg) | Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| BWB Structure | 42,000 | 44.2% |
| Propulsion (H₂ fuel cells) | 18,000 | 18.9% |
| Systems & Equipment | 15,000 | 15.8% |
| Avionics & CAOS | 3,500 | 3.7% |
| H₂ Storage System | 8,500 | 8.9% |
| Furnishings & Interior | 6,000 | 6.3% |
| Operational Items | 2,000 | 2.1% |

## Rationale

OEW limit ensures:
- Competitive payload-range performance
- H₂ propulsion system viability
- Structural efficiency of BWB design
- Economic operational efficiency
- Market competitiveness

## Lightweight Design Features

- Carbon fiber composite primary structure (60% by area)
- Aluminum-lithium secondary structure
- Titanium in high-temperature zones
- Integrated structure-systems design
- Advanced manufacturing techniques

## Verification

- **Method:** Test (Weighing)
- **Procedure:** Certified weighing per CS-25.25
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - As-weighed OEW within allowance range
  - Weight breakdown traceable to design
  - Center of gravity within limits
  - Weight and balance report approved

## Compliance

- CS-25.25: Weight limits
- CS-25.29: Empty weight and corresponding center of gravity
- CS-25.1581: General operating and flight information
