# Weight Distribution Philosophy

## Core Principles

### Balance and Stability
The AMPEL360 BWB design requires careful weight distribution to maintain CG within limits across all operating conditions.

### Design Strategy

**Distributed Loading**
- Passengers spread across 38m width
- Minimize CG shift during boarding/deboarding
- Zone-based seating assignment

**H2 Tank Placement**
- **Center Tanks:** Primary fuel, near CG (25% MAC)
- **Wing Tanks:** Trim fuel, forward/aft of CG
- **Automated Transfer:** CAOS-controlled fuel sequencing

**Cargo Distribution**
- **Forward Cargo:** Balances aft passenger loads
- **Aft Cargo:** Balances forward passenger loads
- **Load Planning:** Optimized by ground systems

## Weight Categories

### Operating Empty Weight (OEW)
- **Structure:** 45,500 kg
- **Systems:** 12,800 kg
- **Furnishings:** 8,200 kg
- **Total OEW:** 66,500 kg

### Maximum Weights
- **MTOW:** 145,000 kg
- **MLW:** 130,000 kg
- **MZFW:** 118,000 kg

### Useful Load
- **Passengers:** 220 × 95 kg = 20,900 kg
- **Cargo:** 15,000 kg
- **H2 Fuel:** 6,500 kg (full tanks)
- **Total Available:** 78,500 kg

## CG Management Strategy

### Static Balance
- OEW CG at 27% MAC (mid-envelope)
- Allows maximum loading flexibility
- Accommodates various load distributions

### Dynamic Balance
- CAOS real-time CG monitoring
- Automated H2 transfer during flight
- Maintains CG within 20-32% MAC (optimal L/D)

### Load Planning
- Ground software computes load distribution
- Passenger seating zones assigned
- Cargo compartment loading sequence
- H2 tank loading sequence

## Safety Margins

### Regulatory Compliance
- CS-25.27: CG limits
- 5% margin from structural limits
- 2% operational warning margins

### CAOS Integration
- Continuous weight and balance monitoring
- Predictive alerting before limit exceedance
- Load redistribution recommendations
