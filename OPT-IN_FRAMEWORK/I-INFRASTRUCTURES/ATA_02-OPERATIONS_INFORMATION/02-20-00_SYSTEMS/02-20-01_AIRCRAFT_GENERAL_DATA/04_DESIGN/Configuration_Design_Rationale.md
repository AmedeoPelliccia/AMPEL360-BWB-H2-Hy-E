# BWB Configuration - Design Rationale

## Key Design Drivers

**Aerodynamic Efficiency (L/D = 21 vs 17 conventional)**
- Entire surface generates lift
- Reduced wetted area
- Lower induced drag

**CG Flexibility (27% MAC usable)**
- H2 tanks: Center body + wing
- Passengers: Distributed across 38m width
- Cargo: Underfloor center body

**H2 Integration Advantages**
- Tank volume in thick center body
- Separation from pax cabin
- Ventilation to upper surface

## Trade-offs Accepted

**Manufacturing Complexity:** Mitigated by composite construction  
**Airport Infrastructure:** Code F gates, special adapters  
**Certification Novelty:** Early EASA/FAA engagement
