3. Identify nose reference point (most forward point)
4. Identify tail reference point (aft-most point on centerline)
5. Setup laser measurement system along centerline
6. Perform multiple measurements (minimum 5)
7. Record data with environmental conditions
8. Perform independent verification measurement
9. Analyze results and prepare report
