## BWB-Specific W&B Considerations

### Blended Wing Body Geometry

#### Center of Gravity Range
- **Wider CG range** than conventional aircraft due to BWB design
- Longitudinal CG: [TBD]% to [TBD]% MAC
- Lateral CG: Symmetric loading critical for BWB
- Vertical CG: Lower than conventional due to BWB shape

#### Loading Distribution
- **Large passenger cabin area** requires careful load distribution
- Multiple loading zones to manage CG
- Passenger seating affects CG more significantly
- Cargo loading coordination essential

#### Structural Considerations
- Floor loading limits different from conventional aircraft
- Load paths through wing-body structure
- Distributed loading preferred over concentrated loads
- Wing structural considerations for cargo

### H₂ Fuel System Weight Effects

#### Fuel Weight Characteristics
- **H₂ is very light:** 1 kg H₂ vs. 0.8 kg Jet-A for same energy
- Significant tank structure weight (cryogenic, insulated)
- Fuel weight change during flight is smaller
- CG shift from H₂ burn is significant

#### Tank Location Effects
- H₂ tanks located [TBD - likely in center body]
- Tank empty vs. full CG effects
- Fuel management for CG control
- Multiple tank CG considerations

#### Fuel Quantity Measurement
- H₂ measured by mass, not volume
- Temperature effects on fuel density
- Pressure effects on fuel density
- CAOS system provides accurate fuel weight

### CAOS Integration

#### Automated Weight and Balance
- Real-time weight calculation
- Automatic CG calculation
- Load optimization recommendations
- CG trend monitoring during flight

#### Digital Load Planning
- Pre-flight load planning in CAOS
- Optimal passenger and cargo distribution
- What-if scenario analysis
- Automated load sheet generation

#### In-Flight Weight Monitoring
- Continuous weight and CG monitoring
- Fuel burn tracking
- CG shift prediction
- Landing weight calculation
