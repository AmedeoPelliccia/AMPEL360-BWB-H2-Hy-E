# Ground Clearance Safety

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-002  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Minimum Ground Clearances

### Static Conditions (Landing Gear Extended, Level)

**At MTOW (185,000 kg):**
- Wingtip: 1.2 m ±0.1 m
- Belly (lowest point): 1.8 m ±0.05 m
- Tail: 2.5 m ±0.1 m
- Engine intake: 2.8 m ±0.1 m

**At MLW (150,000 kg):**
- Wingtip: 1.4 m (increased due to lower weight)
- Belly: 1.9 m
- Tail: 2.6 m
- Engine intake: 2.9 m

### Dynamic Conditions

**During Taxi:**
- Minimum clearance maintained: 1.0 m (wingtip)
- Lateral attitude: ±3° maximum
- Longitudinal: ±2° maximum

**During Takeoff Rotation:**
- Tail clearance critical: 0.5 m minimum
- Maximum rotation rate: 5°/sec
- Rotation angle limit: 12° (BWB-specific)

**During Landing Flare:**
- Tail strike angle: 10° maximum
- Sink rate limit: 3.6 m/s at touchdown

## Clearance Monitoring

**CAOS Monitoring System:**
- Real-time ground clearance calculation
- Wingtip proximity alerts
- Belly clearance warning <1.5m
- Crew advisory display

**Ground Crew Procedures:**
- Visual inspection of pavement condition
- Wing walker requirements (width >35m)
- Enhanced marshalling for tight spaces

## Pavement Requirements

**Surface Quality:**
- Maximum unevenness: 50 mm over 3m
- No debris >25 mm height
- Painted markings <5 mm thickness

**Load Bearing:**
- PCN 80/F/B/W/T minimum
- 185t MTOW distributed loads
- Main gear footprint: 4.5 m² per strut

## Clearance-Related Incidents

**Prevention Measures:**
- Pre-flight walk-around mandatory
- CAOS ground mode active during taxi
- Speed limits: 20 kt normal, 10 kt tight areas
- Wing walkers for wingspan >50m operations
