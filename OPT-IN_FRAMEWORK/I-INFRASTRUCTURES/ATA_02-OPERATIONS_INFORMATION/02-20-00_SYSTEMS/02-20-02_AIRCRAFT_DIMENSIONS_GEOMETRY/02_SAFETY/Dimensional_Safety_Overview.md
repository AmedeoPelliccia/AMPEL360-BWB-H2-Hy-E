# Dimensional Safety Overview

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Released

## Purpose

Define safety considerations, limitations, and procedures related to the aircraft's dimensions and geometry, particularly addressing the unique aspects of the BWB configuration.

## Critical Safety Dimensions

### Ground Clearances (MTOW, level attitude)

| Location | Clearance | Safety Margin | Critical |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Wingtip | 1.2 m | +0.3 m | YES |
| Belly | 1.8 m | +0.2 m | YES |
| Tail | 2.5 m | +0.5 m | NO |
| Engine intake | 2.8 m | +0.5 m | YES |

### BWB-Specific Safety Concerns

**Wide Wingspan (52m):**
- ICAO Code E taxiway requirements (23m minimum width)
- Reduced turning radius vs conventional
- Wingtip strike risk during ground operations
- Enhanced marshalling procedures required

**Low Ground Clearances:**
- 1.2m wingtip clearance at MTOW
- Risk of strike on uneven surfaces
- Careful towing/pushback required
- Pavement quality critical

**Center Body Width (38m):**
- Wider than conventional fuselage
- Special gate adapters required
- Increased blind spots for ground crew
- Enhanced communication procedures

## Risk Assessment

| Hazard | Probability | Severity | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Wingtip strike | Remote | Major | Medium | Enhanced procedures + monitoring |
| Belly strike | Extremely Remote | Catastrophic | Low | Ground inspection + limits |
| FOD ingestion | Probable | Minor | Medium | Intake height + procedures |
| Ground collision | Remote | Major | Medium | Enhanced markings + training |

## Safety Requirements

**CS-25.25(a):** Weight limits shall not exceed structural capabilities  
**CS-25.231:** Ground clearance requirements met  
**ICAO Annex 14:** Aerodrome compatibility demonstrated  
**Company:** Enhanced ground handling procedures mandatory
