# Wide Body Ground Operations

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-030  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB features an exceptionally wide center body (38m) compared to conventional aircraft, presenting unique challenges for ground operations. This document addresses operational procedures and safety considerations specific to this wide-body configuration.

## Dimensional Challenges

### Center Body Width: 38m

**Comparison:**
- Boeing 747: 6.5m fuselage width
- Airbus A380: 7.1m fuselage width
- AMPEL360 BWB: 38m center body width
- **Factor: 5-6× wider than conventional widebody**

### Operational Implications

**Gate Compatibility:**
- Standard gate: 5-8m width accommodation
- AMPEL360 requirement: 28m minimum gate width
- Special adapter gates required
- Multiple jetway positions needed (typically 4-6)

**Taxiway Requirements:**
- ICAO Code E minimum: 23m width
- AMPEL360 optimum: 30m+ width
- Edge clearance critical
- Limited airport compatibility

**Ramp Space:**
- Parking spot: 60m × 70m minimum
- Separation from adjacent aircraft: 15m minimum
- Service vehicle staging area: 800m² required
- Equipment marshalling complexity

## Ground Service Operations

### Multiple Service Points

**Passenger Doors (6 Type A, 6 Type III):**
- Distributed across 38m width
- Simultaneous boarding possible (up to 6 points)
- Jetway coordination complexity
- Ground crew communication critical

**Cargo Doors:**
- Forward cargo: Center (BL 0)
- Aft cargo: Center (BL 0)
- Requires repositioning of equipment
- Time-sequential operations may be needed

**Service Panels:**
- Distributed across width
- Electrical: BL ±12m
- Pneumatic/hydraulic: BL ±8m
- H₂ refueling: BL ±10m
- Water/waste: BL 0, ±15m

### Access and Visibility

**Ground Crew Visibility:**
- Visual communication limited across 38m
- Radio communication mandatory
- Camera systems required (6+ external)
- Coordinator position essential

**Blind Spots:**
- Pilot blind areas: ±45° from nose, below horizon
- Ground equipment in aircraft blind zones
- Camera monitoring critical
- Enhanced situational awareness required

### Service Vehicle Coordination

**Simultaneous Operations:**
- Up to 12 vehicles may be positioned simultaneously
- Coordination complexity high
- Traffic flow management required
- Staged approach/departure procedures

**Vehicle Types:**
- Passenger stairs/jetways: 6
- Cargo loaders: 2
- Fuel truck: 1 (H₂)
- Water/waste: 1
- Catering: 4-6
- Ground power: 2
- Cleaning: 2

## Operational Procedures

### Ground Operations Coordinator (GOC)

**Requirement:**
- Mandatory for all ground service operations
- BWB-qualified and certified
- Radio communication with all units
- Authority to stop operations

**Responsibilities:**
- Overall service coordination
- Vehicle positioning approval
- Safety zone enforcement
- Communication hub
- Emergency coordination

**Equipment:**
- Multi-channel radio
- Position diagram/tablet
- Weather monitoring
- Emergency procedures reference

### Pre-Service Planning

**Service Plan Development:**
1. Aircraft positioning verification
2. Service requirements identification
3. Vehicle staging plan
4. Timing sequence development
5. Safety zones marked

**Coordination Briefing:**
- All service providers
- Sequence and timing
- Communication protocols
- Safety considerations
- Weather impacts

### Service Execution

**Vehicle Approach:**
- Sequential entry to service zones
- GOC approval for each vehicle
- Speed limit: 5 km/h within 20m of aircraft
- Communication maintained continuously

**Service Operations:**
- Commence only after GOC approval
- Continuous position awareness
- Report completion to GOC
- Await departure clearance

**Vehicle Departure:**
- GOC clearance required
- Verify clear path
- Coordinate with incoming vehicles
- Monitor for FOD/equipment left behind

## Special Considerations

### Gate Design Requirements

**Jetway Configuration:**
- Multiple jetway positions (typically 6)
- Specialized adapters for BWB geometry
- Coordinated movement sequencing
- Emergency disconnect capability

**Gate Width:**
- Minimum 28m clear width
- Nose clearance: 10m forward
- Tail clearance: 8m aft
- Wingtip clearance: 5m lateral (each side)

**Utility Connections:**
- Multiple connection points across width
- Extended utility runs (electrical, pneumatic)
- H₂ refueling: Specialized facility (windward access)
- Wastewater: Distributed collection points

### Ramp Operations

**Parking Position:**
- Precision parking critical
- Stop position: ±0.5m tolerance
- Nose gear alignment: ±2° tolerance
- Visual guidance system: Enhanced (BWB-specific)

**Equipment Staging:**
- Pre-positioned service vehicles
- Designated lanes for approach/departure
- Staging area: 50m from aircraft
- Traffic flow management

**Weather Limitations:**
- Wind: Ground service suspended >30 kt
- Visibility: Enhanced lighting required <1000m RVR
- Precipitation: Operations slowed, coordination enhanced
- Lightning: H₂ refueling suspended

### Turnaround Time Optimization

**Standard Turnaround: 45 minutes**

**Time Breakdown:**
- Docking and passenger deplaning: 10 min
- Cleaning and servicing: 25 min
- Boarding: 10 min

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Parallel operations where safe
- Efficient vehicle sequencing
- Pre-positioned equipment
- Trained coordination teams

**Constraints:**
- Width increases complexity
