# Wing Strike Prevention

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-031  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

Wing strike incidents pose a significant risk during ground operations due to the AMPEL360 BWB's 52m wingspan and low wingtip height (1.2m at MTOW). This document provides comprehensive procedures and systems for wing strike prevention.

## Wing Strike Risk Factors

### Physical Characteristics

**Wingspan: 52m**
- ICAO Code E classification
- Wingtip to wingtip: Critical dimension
- Wingtip height: 1.2m (MTOW) to 1.4m (MLW)
- Wingtip lateral position: BL ±26m

**Risk Amplifiers:**
- Wide wingspan limits taxiway selection
- Low wingtip clearance reduces margin
- Limited pilot visibility to wingtips
- Weight-dependent wingtip height variation

### Common Strike Scenarios

**Taxiway Operations:**

- Intersection conflicts

**Ramp Operations:**
- Other aircraft proximity
- Ground support equipment
- Terminal structures
- Jetways and bridges

**Environmental Factors:**

- Low visibility (RVR <550m)
- Pilot request

**Wing Walker Qualifications:**
- BWB-specific certification

- Visual distance estimation skills
- Emergency stop authority
- Annual recertification required

**Equipment:**
- High-visibility vest
- Radio (dedicated frequency)
- Illuminated wands (night)
- Laser rangefinder (optional)
- Weather-appropriate gear

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Planning

**Route Selection:**
1. Review airport diagram for suitable taxiways
2. Identify minimum width points
3. Note wingtip clearance hazards
4. Plan alternative routes
5. Verify lighting availability (night)

**CAOS System Activation:**
1. Ground mode selected
2. Gross weight verification (affects wingtip height)
3. Self-test completion
4. Baseline clearance calculation

**Clearance Assessment:**
- Calculate minimum clearances along route
- Identify critical points requiring enhanced caution
- Determine wing walker requirement
- Brief crew and ground personnel

### Taxi Procedures

**Standard Operations:**
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous
- Speed: 20 kt maximum (straight), 10 kt (turns)
- Visual scan: Continuous (crew + cameras)
- Wing walker updates: Before turns/intersections

**Enhanced Caution Areas:**
- Speed reduction: 5 kt maximum
- CAOS amber alert: Heightened awareness
- Wing walker: Continuous reporting
- Stop-and-verify: At critical points

**CAOS Red Alert Response:**
1. Immediate stop (if safe to do so)
2. Assess situation (displays, cameras, wing walker)
3. Verify obstacle location and clearance
4. Determine corrective action
5. Proceed only when clearance verified

### Gate Entry/Exit

**Approach:**
- Speed: 5 kt maximum
- Wing walkers: Positioned both wingtips
- CAOS: Continuous monitoring
- Nose gear steering: Precise alignment
- Stop positions: Marked and verified

**Clearance Verification:**
- Visual check (cameras, wing walkers)
- CAOS clearance display
- Ground crew confirmation
- Final clearance: <0.5m tolerance

**Parking:**
- Stop position: ±0.5m accuracy
- Final verification: All clearances acceptable
- Parking brake set
- Wing walkers remain until aircraft secured

### Special Procedures

**Reduced Visibility (<550m RVR):**
- Wing walkers: Mandatory
- Additional lighting: Activated
- Speed reduction: 50%
- Enhanced communication
- Increased stop-and-verify frequency

**Night Operations:**
- External lighting: All activated
- Taxi lights: High intensity
- Wingtip strobes: Continuous
- Ramp lighting: Enhanced
- Camera system: Low-light/IR mode

**Adverse Weather:**
- Crosswind >20 kt: Enhanced caution
- Snow/ice: Reduced speed, increased clearance margin
- Heavy rain: Visibility considerations
- Procedures adapted to conditions
