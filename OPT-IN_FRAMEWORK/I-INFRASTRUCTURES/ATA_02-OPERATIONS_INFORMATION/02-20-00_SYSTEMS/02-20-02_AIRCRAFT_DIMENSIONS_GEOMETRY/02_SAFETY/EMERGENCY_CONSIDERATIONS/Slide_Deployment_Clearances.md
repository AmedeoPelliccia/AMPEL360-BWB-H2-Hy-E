- Capacity: 70 persons per slide per 90 seconds
- Sill height: 2.5m above ground (static, MTOW)

**Deployment Clearances:**
- Lateral: 3.5m radius from door
- Forward/aft: 1.5m from door centerline
- Below slide end: 0.5m vertical clearance
- Total footprint: ~7.5m × 11m per slide

**Deployment Clearances:**
- Lateral: 3.0m radius from door
- Forward/aft: 1.2m from door centerline
- Below slide end: 0.5m vertical clearance
- Total footprint: ~6.5m × 9.5m per slide

## Ground Clearance Requirements

### Acceptable Ground Surfaces

**Ideal:**
- Smooth pavement (concrete, asphalt)
- Level or slight gradient (<3°)
- Dry or wet (no standing water)
- No obstacles in deployment zone

**Acceptable:**
- Grass (short, level)
- Compacted gravel (smooth)
- Shallow water (<0.3m depth)
- Snow (compacted, <0.2m depth)
- Ground gradient <5°

**Unacceptable (Slide Damage Risk):**
- Rocks or debris >100mm
- Deep water (>0.5m)
- Ditches, culverts, or depressions
- Sharp objects (metal, glass, etc.)
- Loose/soft sand or mud
- Ground gradient >8°

### Vertical Clearances

**Below Slide Bottom (at full extension):**
- Minimum clearance: 0.5m
- Preferred clearance: 1.0m
- Obstacles: None permitted in slide path

**Deployment Path:**
- Door to slide end: Clear of obstacles
- Width: Slide width + 1m each side
- Height: Sill height to ground + 0.5m

## Obstacle Considerations

### Permitted in Clearance Zone

**During Normal Parking:**
- Removable items only (cones, chocks, etc.)
- Service equipment (if rapidly removable)
- Personnel (evacuation procedures establish movement)

**During Emergency:**
- All obstacles removed or avoided
- Personnel clear before slide deployment
- Equipment pushed aside if blocking

### Prohibited in Clearance Zone

**Permanent:**
- Fixed structures (walls, pillars, etc.)
- Service pits or trenches
- Drainage ditches
- Lighting stanchions (within 3m of door)

**Temporary:**
- Other aircraft (inadequate separation)
- Large service vehicles (immovable rapidly)
- Heavy equipment
- Debris or cargo

## Deployment Procedures

### Automatic Deployment

**Armed Mode:**
- Slides armed during taxi, takeoff, landing
- Door opening: Automatic slide deployment
- Inflation time: 5-6 seconds
- Crew verification: Slide fully inflated before use

**Manual Deployment:**
- Slide disarmed: Manual deployment required
- Crew action: Pull manual inflation handle
- Inflation time: Same (5-6 seconds)

### Deployment Verification

**Crew Checks:**
1. Slide inflated fully
2. Slide attached securely to aircraft
3. Slide positioned correctly (not twisted)
4. Ground surface acceptable
5. Clearances adequate
6. Obstacles: None blocking slide

**Command:**
- "Slide ready, evacuate!" (or similar)
- Direct passengers to slide
- Assist as needed

## Environmental Considerations

### Wind Effects

**Crosswind:**
- Slide deflection: Up to 2m laterally (35 kt wind)
- Clearance margin: Accounts for wind deflection
- Wind limit: 35 kt crosswind (demonstrated)
- Higher winds: Slide integrity maintained but evacuation impacted

**Tailwind/Headwind:**
- Limited effect on deployment
- Inflation time: Unaffected
- Passenger evacuation: Wind assistance or resistance

### Weather Conditions

**Rain/Snow:**
- Slide operation: Unaffected
- Surface: Slippery (passenger caution)
- Visibility: May be reduced

**Ice:**
- Slide deployment: Normal
- Surface: Very slippery (passenger injury risk)
- De-icing: May be required (ground surface)

**Temperature:**
- Slide operation: -40°C to +55°C range
- Inflation: Temperature-compensated
- Materials: Cold-weather certified

## Ground Positioning Considerations

### Gate Parking

**Clearances:**
- Jetways: Retracted or positioned >5m from doors
- Terminal walls: >4m from doors
- Service pits: Avoid in slide deployment zones
- Adjacent aircraft: >15m wingtip to wingtip

**Verification:**
- Daily: Ground marking verification
- Before parking: Obstacle survey
- Airport coordination: Slide clearance zones marked

### Remote Parking

**Surface:**
- Level ramp area preferred
- Grass acceptable if level and clear
- Avoid uneven or soft ground

**Obstacles:**
- Clear of equipment and vehicles
- Personnel: Briefed on clearance zones
- Lighting: Adequate for night operations

## Training and Briefings

### Cabin Crew

**Training:**
- Slide deployment procedures (all types)
- Clearance requirements
- Surface assessment
- Obstacle management
- Evacuation commands

**Recurrent:**
- Annual training
- Slide deployment practice
- Emergency scenarios

### Ground Crew

**Training:**
- Slide clearance zones
- Obstacle management
- Emergency response (rapid removal)

### Passengers

**Pre-Flight Briefing:**
- Exit locations
- Slide evacuation technique
- Leave belongings
- Follow crew instructions

## Emergency Response

### Slide Failure to Deploy

**Crew Actions:**
1. Attempt manual deployment
2. If failed: Use alternate exits
3. Direct passengers to functioning exits
4. Notify other crew

### Slide Deployment Issues

**Partial Inflation:**
- Assess: Can passengers safely evacuate?
- If yes: Proceed with caution
- If no: Use alternate exits

**Slide Damage:**
- Sharp object puncture
- Separation from aircraft
- Twisted or blocked
- Action: Use alternate exits

### Post-Evacuation

**Slide Shutdown:**
- Deflation: Per procedures (if time permits)
- Preservation: For investigation (if accident)
