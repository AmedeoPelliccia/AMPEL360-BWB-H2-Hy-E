# Belly Clearance Requirements

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-013  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB aircraft has a minimum belly clearance of 1.8m at MTOW in level attitude. This relatively low ground clearance requires strict operational procedures to prevent belly strikes and structural damage.

## Critical Dimensions

### Lowest Points

**Primary Lowest Point:**
- Location: STA 18m, BL 0 (center body lowest panel)
- Clearance at MTOW: 1.8m ± 0.05m
- Clearance at MLW: 1.9m
- Clearance at OEW: 2.1m

**Secondary Low Points:**
- Aft fuselage panels: STA 24-28m (1.9m clearance)
- Wing trailing edge: Various stations (2.0-2.2m)
- Gear door edges: When extended (2.5m minimum)

### Clearance Variations

**Weight Effects:**
- MTOW (185,000 kg): 1.8m (critical)
- MLW (150,000 kg): 1.9m (+0.1m)
- OEW (90,000 kg): 2.1m (+0.3m)
- Fuel loading: ~0.2mm per 1000kg

**Attitude Effects:**
- Pitch up 1°: -0.3m belly clearance (aft)
- Pitch down 1°: -0.3m belly clearance (forward)
- Roll 1°: -0.2m belly clearance (low side)
- Combined pitch/roll: Additive effects

## Hazard Scenarios

### Pavement Irregularities

**Bumps and Ridges:**
- Maximum acceptable: 50mm over 3m distance
- Critical concern: Sudden/sharp transitions
- High-speed crossing: Increased impact force
- Inspection requirement: Pre-taxi walk-around

**Depressions and Potholes:**
- Uneven loading risk
- Localized stress on structure
- Gear extension impact
- Water accumulation considerations

**Taxiway Repairs:**
- Temporary surface variations
- Poor compaction issues
- Edge transitions
- Marking thickness (max 5mm)

### Surface Objects

**Taxiway Center Lights:**
- Raised lights: Maximum 25mm height
- Flush lights: Preferred
- Protective covers: Required if >10mm
- Spacing consideration: Wheel track alignment

**Drainage Covers:**
- Flush installation required
- Maximum protrusion: 5mm
- Load rating verification
- Regular inspection required

**FOD (Foreign Object Debris):**
- >25mm objects: Critical threat
- Metal objects: Structural damage risk
- Soft objects: Less critical but remove
- Inspection: Before each taxi operation

### Operational Conditions

**Uneven Surfaces:**
- Grass/unpaved: Operations prohibited
- Construction zones: Avoid or survey
- Snow accumulation: >50mm operations prohibited
- Standing water: Depth verification required

**Speed Effects:**
- High speed: Increased bounce/impact
- Sharp turns: Body roll and clearance loss
- Rapid acceleration/braking: Pitch changes
- Combined maneuvers: Critical monitoring

## Monitoring Systems

### CAOS Ground Clearance System

**Input Parameters:**
- Aircraft gross weight (fuel quantity)
- Landing gear position sensors
- Inertial measurement (pitch/roll)
- Ground speed and acceleration
- Temperature (gear strut pressure)

**Calculations:**
- Real-time belly clearance computation
- Obstacle clearance prediction
- Attitude effect compensation
- Dynamic clearance monitoring

**Alerts:**
- **Green:** >2.0m clearance (normal)
- **Amber:** 1.8-2.0m clearance (caution)
- **Red:** <1.8m clearance (warning, stop if <1.6m)

**Display:**
- Primary flight display indication
- Crew alerting system integration
- Ground mode activation
- Datalink to ground operations

### Visual Inspection

**Pre-Flight Walk-Around:**
- Pavement condition assessment
- FOD survey along taxi route
- Surface defect identification
- Weather impact evaluation

**Crew Visual Cues:**
- Forward visibility limitations (BWB design)
- Nose camera for taxi path
- Belly camera (optional, maintenance)
- External lighting effectiveness

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Procedures

**Flight Crew Actions:**
1. CAOS ground clearance system activation
2. Gross weight verification (fuel state)
3. Route briefing and hazard awareness
4. Camera system check (nose, belly)

**Ground Crew Actions:**
1. Taxi route inspection
2. FOD removal from path
3. Surface condition report to crew
4. Any obstructions communicated

### Taxi Procedures

**Standard Operations:**
- Speed: 20 kt maximum on smooth surfaces
- Acceleration: Gradual to avoid pitch changes
- Braking: Smooth to avoid pitch-down
- Turns: Smooth to minimize roll

**Restricted Operations:**
- Rough surfaces: 10 kt maximum
- Temporary repairs: 5 kt maximum, inspection first
- Wet conditions: 50% speed reduction
- Clearance <2.0m: CAOS continuous monitoring

**Prohibited Operations:**
- Grass or unpaved surfaces
- Snow depth >50mm
- Ice coverage (any thickness)
- Standing water depth >100mm

### Pavement Requirements

**New Pavement (Construction):**
- Smoothness: Maximum 3mm variance per 3m
- Levelness: Maximum 1% grade change per 30m
- Transitions: Gradual (max 1:20 slope)
- Surface texture: Adequate for braking/traction

**Existing Pavement (Maintenance):**
- Inspection: Monthly minimum
- Defect repair: Priority for >25mm height
- Crack sealing: Flush with surface
- Marking thickness: <5mm buildup

## Special Considerations

### BWB Design Factors

**Wide Center Body:**
- Larger surface area at risk
- Multiple potential contact points
- Distributed load implications
- Inspection complexity

**Low Wing Placement:**
- Limited ground clearance by design
- Fuel load effect significant
- Structural integration with body
- Monitoring system integration

### Hydrogen System Integration

**Belly-Mounted Components:**
- H₂ storage tanks: Not lowest point (internal)
- Fuel lines: Protected routing
- Venting systems: Clearance adequate
- Access panels: Flush mounting

**Impact Protection:**
- Critical components: Reinforced mounting
- Strike detection: Sensors installed
- Leak detection: Post-strike inspection
- Emergency response: Procedures defined
