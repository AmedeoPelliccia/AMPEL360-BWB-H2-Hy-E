## BWB-Specific Considerations

### Wide Body Challenges

**Center Body Width (38m):**
- Multiple simultaneous GSE operations
- Increased coordination requirements
- Visual communication limitations
- Enhanced radio procedures

**Solutions:**
- Designated equipment zones
- Coordinated approach procedures
- GSE traffic management
- CAOS external monitoring integration

### Low Ground Clearance

**Wingtip Height (1.2m at MTOW):**
- Equipment height restrictions
- Approach path planning
- Personnel awareness training
- Visual marking requirements

**Solutions:**
- Height-restricted equipment zones
- Pavement condition verification
- CAOS clearance monitoring
- Enhanced lighting (night ops)

### Large Wingspan (52m)

**Equipment Positioning:**
- Simultaneous operations spacing
- Wingtip clearance zones
- Equipment staging areas
- Traffic flow management

**Solutions:**
- Designated equipment lanes
- Spacing enforcement
- Wing walker coordination
- Ground radar monitoring

## Clearance Verification Procedures

### Pre-Operation Checks

**Equipment Operators:**
1. Visual clearance verification
2. CAOS clearance system check
3. Communication verification
4. Emergency stop procedure review

**Ground Coordinator:**
1. Equipment spacing verification
2. Traffic flow clearance
3. Wing walker positioning
4. Weather considerations

### During Operations

**Continuous Monitoring:**

- Clearance maintenance
- Communication effectiveness
- Incident prevention

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
- Weather changes (wind)
- Aircraft movement (servicing)
- Equipment repositioning
- Personnel safety zones

## Equipment Certification

### Approval Requirements

**All GSE must be certified for:**
