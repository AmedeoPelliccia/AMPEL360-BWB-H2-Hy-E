# RQ-02-11-10-006: Dimensional Tolerances

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

All aircraft primary dimensions shall be maintained within specified tolerances to ensure aerodynamic performance, structural integrity, and operational compliance.

## Dimensional Tolerance Requirements

**Critical Dimensions (±0.05m):**
- Overall height
- Ground clearances (belly, tail, wingtip)
- Control surface positions

**Primary Dimensions (±0.1m):**
- Wingspan
- Overall length
- Center body width
- Main gear track

**Secondary Dimensions (±0.2m):**
- Door locations
- Equipment bay dimensions
- Service panel locations

## Rationale

**Aerodynamic Performance:**
- Maintains designed airflow characteristics
- Ensures laminar flow regions
- Preserves L/D ratio
- Prevents flow separation

**Structural Integrity:**
- Load path alignment
- Joint fit-up requirements
- Fastener hole alignment
- Stress concentration control

**Operational Safety:**
- Ground clearance margins
- Equipment interference prevention
- Emergency exit functionality
- Control system operation

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Photogrammetry during assembly
- Laser scanning verification
- CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) checks
- Final As-Built survey

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All dimensions within specified tolerances
- Symmetry requirements met
- Documentation complete
- Sign-off by Quality Control

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- [ATA iSpec 2200](https://www.ataebooks.org/product-category/ispec-2200/) (Tolerancing)
