# BWB Geometry Description

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-OVW-002  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Blended Wing Body Configuration

The AMPEL360 features a true blended wing body (BWB) configuration where the fuselage and wing merge into a single lifting surface with no distinct demarcation.

### Planform Geometry

**Leading Edge:**
- Continuous compound curve from centerline to tip
- 37° sweep at leading edge
- Optimized for M0.82 cruise
- Natural laminar flow forward section

**Trailing Edge:**
- Forward sweep in outer sections (-12°)
- Straight section at center body
- Integrated elevon control surfaces
- Length: 45 m total span

**Wingtips:**
- Blended winglet design
- Height: 3.5 m above wing plane
- Cant angle: 75° from horizontal
- 8% induced drag reduction

### Cross-Section Geometry

**Center Body (Station 15.0m):**
- Width: 38.0 m
- Height: 8.5 m (internal cabin)
- Thickness-to-chord ratio: 15%
- Double-bubble pressurized section
- H₂ tanks in upper section

**Mid-Wing (Station 30.0m):**
- Chord: 18.0 m
- Thickness-to-chord: 12%
- Transition from body to wing
- Passenger seating continues

**Outer Wing (Station 45.0m):**
- Chord: 8.0 m
- Thickness-to-chord: 8%
- Pure aerodynamic surface
- Fuel cell integration region

## Volume Distribution

**Pressurized Volume:** 1,850 m³
- Passenger cabin: 1,200 m³
- Cargo bay: 150 m³
- Systems bays: 500 m³

**Unpressurized Volume:** 800 m³
- H₂ fuel tanks: 350 m³
- Wheel wells: 150 m³
- Aerodynamic fairing: 300 m³

## Geometric Advantages

**Aerodynamic:**
- 30% more efficient than conventional (L/D = 21 vs 17)
- Lower wetted area per unit volume
- Natural laminar flow over 40% chord

**Structural:**
- 15% weight savings (distributed loads)
- Lower bending moments
- Efficient pressure vessel shape

**Operational:**
- Wide CG range: 27% MAC vs 20% conventional
- Excellent payload flexibility
- Reduced noise footprint (50% below Chapter 14)
