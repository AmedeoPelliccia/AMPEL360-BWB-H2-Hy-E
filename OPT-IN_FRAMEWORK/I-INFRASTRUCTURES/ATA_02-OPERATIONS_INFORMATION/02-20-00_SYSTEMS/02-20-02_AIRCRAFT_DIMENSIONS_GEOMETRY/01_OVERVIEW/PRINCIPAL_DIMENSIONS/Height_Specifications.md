- Top to hangar ceiling: 1.5 m minimum
- Overall envelope: 16.0 m height clearance

**Dynamic Clearances (Taxiing):**
- Top to overhead obstruction: 3.0 m minimum
- Sufficient for all airport overhead structures
- Bridge clearance: 16.0 m typical runway bridges

### Service Equipment Heights

**Ground Service Equipment Access:**
- Catering trucks: Door sill at WL 4.3 m (suitable for standard trucks)
- Passenger stairs: Door sill at WL 4.3 m (mobile stairs up to 6.0 m)
- Cargo loaders: Floor at WL 2.2 m (standard wide-body loaders)
- Fuel (H₂) connection: WL 2.5 m (ground-level access)

### Bridge Compatibility

**Passenger Loading Bridges:**
- Door sill height: WL 4.3 m
- Compatible with adjustable bridges: WL 2.5 - 6.5 m range
- Standard wide-body bridge configuration

## Airport Infrastructure

### Hangar Requirements

**Minimum Hangar Height:**
- Door opening: 16.0 m
- Interior height: 18.0 m (with overhead cranes)
- Maintenance platform access: Multiple levels required

**Compatible Hangars:**
- Wide-body aircraft hangars (Boeing 777/787, Airbus A350)
- Height similar to conventional wide-bodies
- No special modifications required

### Gate Compatibility

**Bridge Height Range:**

## Operational Limitations

### Tail Strike Protection

**Rotation Angle Limits:**
- Maximum rotation: 12° (at takeoff)
- Tail clearance at 12°: 0.5 m
- Tail strike angle: 14° (design limit)

**Landing Attitude:**
