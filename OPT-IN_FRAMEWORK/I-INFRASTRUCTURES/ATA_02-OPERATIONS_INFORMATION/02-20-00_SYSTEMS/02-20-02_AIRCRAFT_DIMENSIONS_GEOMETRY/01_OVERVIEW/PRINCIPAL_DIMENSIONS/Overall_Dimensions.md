# Overall Dimensions

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-PRIN-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## General Dimensions

The AMPEL360 BWB H₂ aircraft overall dimensions are defined by the extreme points of the aircraft structure in each axis.

### Maximum Dimensions

| Dimension | Value | Unit | Tolerance | Measurement Point |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Overall Wingspan** | 52.0 | m | ±0.1 | Wingtip to wingtip (including winglets) |
| **Overall Length** | 38.2 | m | ±0.1 | Nose apex to tail trailing edge |
| **Overall Height** | 14.5 | m | ±0.05 | Ground level to highest point |

### Comparison with Conventional Aircraft

| Parameter | AMPEL360 BWB | Conventional (A320) | Difference |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| Wingspan | 52.0 m | 35.8 m | +45% |
| Length | 38.2 m | 37.6 m | +2% |
| Height | 14.5 m | 11.8 m | +23% |
| Wing Area | 845 m² | 122.6 m² | +590% |

### ICAO Classification

**Aerodrome Code:** E  
**Description:** Wingspan 52m to 65m  
**Implications:**
- Requires Code E taxiways (minimum 23m width)
- Code E apron stands
- Standard wide-body gate compatibility
- No special airport infrastructure required beyond Code E

### Physical Envelope

The aircraft physical envelope defines the maximum space occupied during:

**Static Condition (Parked):**
- Length: 38.2 m
- Width: 52.0 m
- Height: 14.5 m
- Required parking area: 38.2 m × 52.0 m = 1,986 m²

**Dynamic Condition (Taxiing):**
- Swept path width: 56.0 m (including wingtip clearance)
- Minimum turning radius: 42 m (centerline)
- Minimum taxiway width: 23 m (ICAO Code E)

## Operational Considerations

### Ground Operations

**Minimum Clearances Required:**
- Lateral: 4.0 m from wingtip to obstacle
- Vertical: 2.0 m from highest point
- Longitudinal: 3.0 m from nose/tail to obstacle

### Airport Compatibility

**Compatible Airports:**
- All ICAO Code E or higher airports
- Approximately 500+ airports worldwide
- All major international hubs
- Most regional airports with wide-body capability

**Incompatible Airports:**
- ICAO Code C or lower (wingspan limit 36m)
- Airports with narrow taxiways (<23m)
- Airports with restricted apron space

### Hangar Requirements

**Minimum Hangar Dimensions:**
- Length: 42 m (with clearance)
- Width: 56 m (with clearance)
- Height: 16 m (with clearance)
- Door opening: 18 m height minimum

**Typical Wide-Body Hangar:** Suitable for Boeing 777/787 or Airbus A350 can accommodate AMPEL360.

## Measurement Reference

All dimensions measured from:
- **Reference Datum:** Nose apex (Station 0, BL 0, WL 0)
- **Aircraft Condition:** Empty, landing gear extended, level attitude
- **Temperature:** 20°C standard conditions
- **Load:** Unloaded structure (no fuel, payload, or crew)

## Regulatory Compliance

- **EASA CS-25:** Subpart B - Flight
- **FAA Part 25:** Certification standards
- **ICAO Annex 14:** Aerodrome design and operations
- **ATA iSpec 2200:** Documentation format
