**Version:** 1.0.0

## Trade Study Summary

### Options Evaluated

| Wingspan | AR | L/D | Code | Airports | Weight | Selection |
|----------|----|----|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 48m | 2.7 | 19.5 | E | 95% | -5% | Rejected (low efficiency) |
| **52m** | **3.2** | **21.0** | **E** | **87%** | **Baseline** | **SELECTED** |
| 56m | 3.7 | 21.8 | F | 45% | +3% | Rejected (airport limited) |
| 60m | 4.2 | 22.3 | F | 35% | +6% | Rejected (airport limited) |

### Selection Criteria Weighting

**Performance (30%):**
- L/D ratio target: >20
- Range efficiency: 30% improvement vs baseline
- Cruise speed: M0.82 capability

**Operational (40%):**
- Airport compatibility: >80% major hubs
- ICAO Code: E preferred (F acceptable with justification)
- Ground handling: Standard procedures preferred

**Economic (20%):**
- Structural weight: Minimize
- Manufacturing: Standard hangar compatibility
- Operating costs: Competitive with conventional

**Technical Risk (10%):**
- Technology maturity
- Certification path
- Supply chain availability

### Detailed Analysis: 52m Selection

**Aerodynamic Performance:**
- Aspect ratio 3.2: Optimal for BWB configuration
- L/D = 21: Exceeds target (20), acceptable margin
- Induced drag: Well-managed with blended winglets
- Compressibility: 37° sweep adequate for M0.82

**Airport Compatibility:**
- ICAO Code E: 65m limit (52m provides 13m margin)
- Compatible airports: 87% of target network
  - Major hubs: 95% compatible
  - Regional: 75% compatible
  - Total network: 247 airports
- Taxiway width: 23m minimum (tight but acceptable)

**Structural Considerations:**
- Bending moment: Manageable with composite wing box
- Weight: Baseline (reference for trade study)
- Fatigue: 60,000 cycles demonstrated
- Manufacturing: Standard autoclave (12m sections)

**Ground Operations:**
- Turning radius: 42m (tighter than conventional)
- Wingtip clearance: 1.2m at MTOW (acceptable with CAOS)
- Gate compatibility: Wide-body gates with adapter
- Towing: Dual tow bar system required

### Why NOT 56m or 60m?

**Airport Limitation (Critical):**
- Code F airports (>65m): Only 35-45% of network
- Major business routes excluded:
  - Many European secondary cities
  - Asian regional hubs
  - US mid-size airports
- Business case deteriorates significantly

**Efficiency Gain Insufficient:**
- 56m: +3.8% efficiency vs 52m
  - Lost revenue: -15% fewer airports
  - Net economic impact: NEGATIVE
- 60m: +6.2% efficiency vs 52m
  - Lost revenue: -25% fewer airports  
  - Net economic impact: HIGHLY NEGATIVE

**Technical Complexity:**
- Manufacturing: Larger autoclaves required
- Transport: Oversized load restrictions
- Assembly: Larger hangar required
- Cost increase: +15-20%

### Why NOT 48m?

**Performance Insufficient:**
- L/D = 19.5 (7% below target)
- Range penalty: 350 NM reduction
- Fuel burn: +8% per flight hour
- Operating cost: +5% (uncompetitive)

**Mission Capability:**
- Trans-Atlantic: Marginal (strong headwind risk)
- Hot/high airports: Payload restrictions
- Market position: Not differentiated enough

### Validation

**CFD Analysis:**
- Wingspan 52m modeled with 10M+ cells
- L/D = 21.0 ±0.2 confirmed
- Stall characteristics acceptable
- Control power adequate

**Wind Tunnel:**
- 1:10 scale model (5.2m span)
- Force and moment measurements
- Flow visualization
- Results validated CFD ±2%

**Airport Survey:**
- 284 airports evaluated worldwide
- 247 airports compatible (87%)
- Route network: 95% coverage achieved
- Business case: POSITIVE

## Final Decision Rationale

**52m wingspan selected because:**
1. **Optimal balance** of efficiency (L/D=21) and airport access (87%)
2. **ICAO Code E** maintains broad operational flexibility
3. **Aspect ratio 3.2** is optimal for BWB configuration  
4. **Structural weight** and manufacturing cost acceptable
5. **Business case** strongly positive vs alternatives
6. **Technical risk** low (proven technologies)
