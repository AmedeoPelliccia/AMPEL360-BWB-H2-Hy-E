# Belly Clearance Strategy

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-GC-004  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Design Philosophy

**Objective:** Ensure adequate ground clearance for center body (belly) during all ground and flight operations.

## Clearance Specifications

### Minimum Clearance Points

**Station 15000 (Maximum Width):**
- Clearance: 0.8m (MTOW static)
- Location: Between main gear posts
- Critical point: Lowest point of aircraft

**Station 10000 (Forward Center Body):**
- Clearance: 1.0m
- Forward cargo door location
- Service vehicle access

**Station 20000 (Aft Center Body):**
- Clearance: 0.9m
- APU access area
- Systems service points

### CS-25.231 Compliance

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Positive clearance: All points ✓
- Level attitude: Maintained ✓
- Tail-down (15°): 0.3m minimum ✓
- **AMPEL360 exceeds requirements**

## Design Features

### Structural Protection

**Critical Areas:**
- Landing gear doors
- Cargo doors (lower)
- Systems access panels
- APU intake/exhaust

**Protection Methods:**
- Reinforced structure (sacrificial if needed)
- Drainage provisions
- Corrosion protection
- Impact-resistant materials

### Ground Equipment Clearance

**Service Vehicles:**
- Cargo loaders: 0.5m clearance required
- Fuel trucks: 0.6m clearance required
- Tugs/tow bars: 0.4m clearance required
- All equipment: Compatible ✓

### Drainage Design

**Water Drainage:**
- Lowest points: Drain holes provided
- Flow paths: Designed to avoid pooling
- Corrosion protection: Enhanced coating
- Inspection: Accessible

## Operational Considerations

### Taxi Operations

**Level Attitude:**
- All surfaces: >0.8m clearance
- Uneven pavement: ±0.1m tolerance
- Safety margin: Adequate

**Soft Field Operations:**
- Reduced clearance: Acceptable
- Speed limit: 10 knots
- Caution procedures: Defined
- CAOS monitoring: Active

### Takeoff/Landing

**Rotation (Takeoff):**
- Belly clearance increases (beneficial)
- No strike risk
- Normal rotation rates: Safe

**Landing (Touchdown):**
- Gear stroke: 0.4m
- Belly clearance: Maintained >0.4m
- Hard landing: Still positive clearance
- Design validated

### Adverse Conditions

**Uneven Surface:**
- Pitch variation: ±3°
- Clearance maintained: >0.5m
- Acceptable for operations

**Over-rotation:**
- Tail strike before belly strike
- Tail skid protection: Primary
- Belly contact: Secondary concern

## CAOS Integration

### Belly Clearance Sensors

**Sensor Array:**
- Quantity: 4 sensors
- Location: Critical points (FS 10k, 15k, 20k, 25k)
- Technology: Ultrasonic
- Range: 0-2m

### Monitoring and Alerts

**Display:**
- Minimum clearance shown
- Real-time update: 10 Hz
- Color coding: Green/Yellow/Red

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Green: >1.0m (normal)
- Yellow: 0.5m to 1.0m (caution)
- Red: <0.5m (warning, immediate action)

## Maintenance Access

### Lower Surface Access

**Access Panels:**
- Quantity: 24 major panels
- Size: 0.8m × 0.8m (typical)
- Fasteners: Quick-release (1/4 turn)
- Sealing: Weather-tight

**Service Points:**
- Cargo door actuators: Accessible
- Gear door mechanisms: Accessible
- Systems components: Reachable
- Inspection points: Defined

### Ground Support Equipment

**Maintenance Stands:**
- Height: 0.5m to 1.5m (adjustable)
- Clearance: Adequate for all work
- Safety: Stable and secure
- Standard equipment: Compatible

## Protection Design

### Impact Protection

**Sacrificial Elements:**
- Material: Aluminum honeycomb
- Location: Critical points
- Replacement: Bolt-on sections
- Cost: Minimal

**Reinforced Structure:**
- Landing gear door frames
- Cargo door surrounds
- Service panel edges
- Enhanced thickness

### Corrosion Protection

**Coating System:**
- Primer: Epoxy-based
- Topcoat: Polyurethane
- Thickness: 150 μm total
- Life: 10 years before refurbishment

**Drainage:**
- All low points: Drain holes
- Moisture traps: Eliminated
- Inspection: Annual

## Validation

### Ground Tests

**Static Load Test:**
- All gear positions tested
- Clearances verified
- Deformation measured
- Results: As predicted

**Ground Handling Simulation:**
- Various surface conditions
- Uneven pavement (3° pitch/roll)
- Soft field operations
- All scenarios: Safe

### Flight Testing (Planned)

**Test Program:**
- Takeoff rotations: Various rates
- Landing touchdowns: Various sink rates
- Crosswind landings: Up to 38 knots
- Hard landings: 3.6 m/s
