**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-GC-005  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

**Purpose:** Provide protection against ground strikes during abnormal operations while minimizing structural damage and ensuring safe recovery.

## Tail Strike Protection

### Tail Skid Design

**Type:** Replaceable sacrificial element

**Location:**
- Station: FS 28000 (aft end)
- Height: 0.15m above skin
- Material: Titanium alloy (wear-resistant)

**Activation:**
- Pitch angle: 15.5° nose-up
- CS-25.231 requirement: 15° minimum
- **Safety margin: 0.5°**

**Design Features:**
- Replaceable element: Bolt-on (4 bolts)
- Wear indicator: Visual inspection
- Contact area: 200 cm² (distributed load)
- Load capacity: 50 kN (design load)

### Strike Event Management

**Normal Rotation:**
- Rate: 3°/second (target)
- Maximum angle: 12° (liftoff)
- Tail strike risk: NONE

**Tail Strike Scenario:**
- Excessive rotation: >15.5°
- Skid contact: Designed
- Aircraft response: Controlled
- Pilot action: Reduce pitch

**Post-Strike:**
- Inspection: Required (visual)
- Skid replacement: If worn/damaged
- Structure inspection: NDT check
- Flight continuation: Usually permitted

## Wingtip Strike Protection

### Wingtip Design

**Structural:**
- Material: Carbon fiber composite
- Reinforced tip: Enhanced layup
- Energy absorption: Built-in
- Damage tolerance: Certified

**Ground Contact Risk:**
- Probability: EXTREMELY LOW
- Bank angle limit: 5° (warning)
- Clearance (5° bank): 1.2m
- CAOS alert: Active before risk

### Protection Features

**Tip Cap:**
- Material: Fiberglass (replaceable)
- Attachment: Bonded and fastened
- Wear resistance: Good
- Replacement: 2 hours per side

**Structural Design:**
- Progressive failure: If struck
- Energy absorption: Composite crush
- Residual strength: Maintained
- Safe flight: Possible

## Belly Strike Protection

### Design Philosophy

**Primary Defense:** Adequate clearance (0.8m minimum)

**Secondary Defense:** Structural reinforcement at critical points

### Protection Areas

**Landing Gear Doors:**
- Reinforced frames
- Damage-tolerant design
- Sealing maintained (if possible)
- Inspection after strike

**Cargo Doors:**
- Reinforced surrounds
- Latch protection
- Seal integrity (priority)
- Pressure test after strike

**Systems Access Panels:**
- Secured fasteners (captured)
- Panel retention (if struck)
- Fluid containment
- Fire protection maintained

### Strike Event Response

**Minor Contact (<10 kN):**
- Inspection: Visual
- Damage: Cosmetic likely
- Airworthiness: Usually maintained
- Repair: Schedule next maintenance

**Significant Contact (10-50 kN):**
- Inspection: Detailed (NDT)
- Damage: Structural possible
- Airworthiness: Engineering assessment
- Repair: Before next flight

**Major Contact (>50 kN):**
- Inspection: Comprehensive
- Damage: Extensive likely
- Airworthiness: Suspended
- Repair: Major maintenance

## Nose Gear Door Protection

### Design

**Door Type:** Single forward-hinging door

**Protection:**
- Reinforced leading edge
- Debris guards
- Drainage provisions
- Corrosion protection

**Strike Scenario:**
- Premature extension: Possible
- Door contact risk: LOW
- Protection: Reinforced structure
- Recovery: Design permits

## CAOS Strike Prevention

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Parameters Monitored:**
- Pitch attitude (tail strike warning)
- Bank angle (wingtip warning)
- Clearance sensors (belly warning)
- Gear position (all operations)

### Alerts

**Tail Strike Warning:**
- Activation: 14° pitch (1.5° before skid)
- Display: Flashing red "TAIL LOW"
- Audio: Continuous warning tone
- Pilot action: Reduce pitch immediately

**Wingtip Warning:**
- Activation: 4° bank (1° before caution)
- Display: Yellow "BANK ANGLE"
- Audio: Single chime
- Pilot action: Level wings

**Belly Clearance:**
- Activation: <0.5m clearance
- Display: Red "LOW CLEARANCE"
- Audio: Intermittent tone
- Pilot action: Stop, assess situation

## Post-Strike Procedures

### Inspection Requirements

**Immediate (Before Next Flight):**
- Visual inspection: All affected areas
- Skid inspection: Wear/damage
- Structural check: Deformation
- Systems check: Functionality

**Detailed (If Damage Found):**
- NDT inspection: Critical areas
- Structural analysis: Load capability
- Systems test: Full functionality
- Engineering disposition: Required

### Repair Classification

**Minor Repair (Skid Replacement):**
- Time: 2 hours
- Tools: Standard
- Parts: Skid element
- Return to service: Immediate

**Moderate Repair (Panel/Door):**
- Time: 8-24 hours
- Tools: Specialized
- Parts: Panels, fasteners, seals
- Return to service: After inspection

**Major Repair (Structure):**
- Time: Days to weeks
- Tools: Manufacturing equipment
- Parts: Structural components
- Return to service: After certification
