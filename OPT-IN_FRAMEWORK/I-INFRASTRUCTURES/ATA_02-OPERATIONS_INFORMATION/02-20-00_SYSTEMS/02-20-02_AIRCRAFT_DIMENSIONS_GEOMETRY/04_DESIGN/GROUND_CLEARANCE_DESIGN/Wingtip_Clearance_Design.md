## Requirements

### Regulatory

**CS-25.231:** Positive clearance at all times
- Level attitude: Required
- Tail-down attitude: Required
- Dynamic conditions: Considered

### Operational

**AMPEL360 Enhanced Requirements:**

- Taxi bank (5°): 1.2m minimum
- Safety margin: 300mm above regulatory
- CAOS monitoring: Integrated

## Clearance Analysis

### Static Conditions

**Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW):**
- Gear compression: Maximum
- Wingtip height: 2.8m
- Ground distance: Safe
- **Margin: 2.3m above CS-25 minimum (0.5m)**

**Operating Empty Weight (OEW):**
- Gear compression: Reduced
- Wingtip height: 3.1m
- Additional margin: 0.3m
- Enhanced safety

### Dynamic Conditions

**Taxi Operations (5° bank):**
- Low wingtip: 1.2m
- High wingtip: 4.4m
- CAOS alert: Yellow warning
- Operational limit: Acceptable

**Takeoff Rotation:**
- Wing flexure: Upward (beneficial)
- Clearance increases: +0.2m
- No strike risk

**Landing Touchdown:**
- Sink rate: 3 m/s design
- Gear stroke: 0.4m
- Clearance maintained: 2.4m
- Safe margin

## Contributing Factors

### Landing Gear Height

**Main Gear:**
- Extended length: 3.2m
- Wheel radius: 0.6m
- **Contribution to clearance: 2.6m**

### Wing Geometry

**Dihedral:** 0° (BWB configuration)
- No dihedral effect (unlike conventional)
- Clearance uniform across span
- Simplified design

**Wingtip Height (geometric):**
- From gear datum: 2.8m
- BWB flat configuration
- No upward angle at tip

### Winglet

**Blended Winglet:**
- Height: 2.2m above wing
- Total height: 5.0m above ground
- Cant angle: 65°
- Adequate clearance

## Ground Operations

### Taxi Limits

**Normal Operations:**
- Bank angle limit: 3°
- Speed limit: 30 knots
- Clearance: 1.8m (conservative)

**Adverse Conditions:**
- Bank angle limit: 2°
- Speed limit: 20 knots
- Surface monitoring: CAOS
- Enhanced caution

### Turning Radius

**Minimum Turn Radius: 42m**
- Nose wheel steering: ±75°
- Wingtip arc: Calculated
- Obstacle clearance: 1.5m minimum
- Validated by simulation

### Parking/Gate Operations

**Gate Positioning:**
- Clearance to jet bridge: 2.0m
- Clearance to buildings: 3.0m
- Wing walker: Required (tight quarters)
- CAOS guidance: Active

## CAOS Integration

### Proximity Sensors

**Wingtip Sensors:**
- Quantity: 8 (4 per wingtip)
- Technology: Ultrasonic + radar
- Range: 0-5m
- Accuracy: ±50mm

### Alert Levels

**Green (Normal):**
- Clearance: >2.0m
- Status: Normal operations
- Display: Distance shown

**Yellow (Caution):**
- Clearance: 1.2m to 2.0m
- Status: Heightened awareness
- Display: Flashing yellow
- Audio: Single chime

**Red (Warning):**
- Clearance: <1.2m
- Status: Immediate action required
- Display: Flashing red
- Audio: Continuous tone

## Validation
