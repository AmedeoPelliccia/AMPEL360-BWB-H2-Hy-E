# Dimensional Design Philosophy

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Released

## Core Design Principles

### 1. BWB Configuration Optimization

**Philosophy:** Maximize the unique advantages of blended wing body configuration while maintaining practical operational compatibility.

**Key Decisions:**
- Pure BWB (no distinct fuselage)
- Continuous lifting surface
- Integrated center body and wing
- No external fairings or pods

**Benefits Achieved:**
- 30% aerodynamic efficiency improvement
- 15% structural weight savings
- 50% noise reduction
- Optimal H₂ tank integration

### 2. Airport Infrastructure Compatibility

**Philosophy:** Design must operate at existing ICAO Code E airports with minimal infrastructure modifications.

**Constraints Applied:**
- Wingspan ≤52m (Code E limit 65m)
- Taxiway compatibility: 23m minimum
- Standard gate positions with adapters
- PCN 80 pavement loading

**Trade-off Acceptance:**
- Slightly lower aspect ratio (3.2 vs 4.0 ideal)
- Enhanced ground handling procedures required
- Tighter operational margins than conventional

### 3. Safety-First Dimensional Design

**Philosophy:** All dimensional decisions prioritize safety margins and failure tolerance.

**Safety Features:**
- Ground clearances exceed CS-25.231 minimums
- 300mm safety margin on critical clearances
- CAOS real-time monitoring integration
- Multiple failure mode analysis completed

### 4. Manufacturing & Assembly Feasibility

**Philosophy:** Dimensions must enable practical manufacturing, transport, and assembly.

**Manufacturing Considerations:**
- Modular construction (3 main sections)
- Maximum transport width: 12m (center body sections)
- Final assembly in existing wide-body hangars
- Tooling compatibility with composite processes

### 5. Operational Efficiency

**Philosophy:** Geometry optimized for real-world airline operations, not just theoretical performance.

**Operational Priorities:**
- Turnaround time: 45 minutes target
- Standard ground equipment where possible
- Crew training minimized vs conventional transition
- Maintenance access prioritized

## Design Evolution

### Phase 1: Conceptual (2023 Q1-Q2)
- Initial wingspan: 60m
- Aspect ratio: 4.0
- ICAO Code F (rejected - limited airports)

### Phase 2: Refinement (2023 Q3-Q4)
- Wingspan reduced to 52m
- Aspect ratio: 3.2 (acceptable for BWB)
- Code E compatibility achieved

### Phase 3: Optimization (2024 Q1-Q4)
- Center body width optimized: 38m
- Thickness distribution refined
- Ground clearances validated
- Manufacturing plan validated

### Phase 4: Validation (2025 Q1-present)
- Wind tunnel validation complete
- Ground handling simulations complete
- Digital twin geometry model complete
- Certification basis agreed
