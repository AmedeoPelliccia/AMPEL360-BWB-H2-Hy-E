**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-CB-002  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Decision Summary

**Selected Width:** 38.0 meters

**Decision Date:** 2024-02-20  
**Approved By:** Chief Engineer, CEO, Program Manager  
**Status:** Baseline Frozen

## Requirements Driving Width

### Passenger Capacity

**Target:** 220 passengers (2-class)

**Seating Analysis:**
- Business: 30 seats (2-2-2) = 6-abreast
- Economy: 190 seats (mixed 8/9-abreast)
- Required cabin width: 36-38m

**38m Enables:**
- 8-abreast center section (comfortable)
- Smooth taper to wing sections
- Multiple aisles (3)
- Emergency egress compliant

### H₂ Tank Integration

**Requirement:** 8,000 kg LH₂

**Volume Analysis:**
- Required usable: 112.7 m³
- With margins: 132.5 m³
- Available at 38m width: 350 m³
- **Margin:** 164% (excellent)

**38m Benefits:**
- 4 independent tanks possible
- Adequate separation
- Thermal management feasible
- Safety margins met

### Structural Efficiency

**Load Distribution:**
- 38m spreads wing loads efficiently
- Reduced stress concentrations
- Multiple load paths available
- Optimal bending moment distribution

**Weight Impact:**
- Center body structure: 18,500 kg
- 35m alternative: 17,900 kg (-600 kg)
- 42m alternative: 19,800 kg (+1,300 kg)
- **38m optimal balance**

## Operational Considerations

### Airport Gate Compatibility

**Gate Availability:**
- Standard wide-body gates: 42-45m width
- 38m aircraft: Adapter required (minor)
- Compatible airports: 87% of network
- Gate availability: Not limiting factor

**Ground Operations:**
- Towing: Dual towbar system
- Pushback: Standard equipment
- Servicing: Custom adapter plates
- Turnaround: 45 minutes achievable

### Manufacturing

**Production Sections:**
- 3 major sections: 12m max width each
- Standard transport: Road/rail compatible
- Autoclave size: Within capacity
- Final assembly: Existing facility

**Cost Impact:**
- Tooling: $45M (38m)
- 35m alternative: $42M (-7%)
- 42m alternative: $52M (+16%)
- **38m acceptable cost**

## Market Analysis

### Seating Capacity Rationale

**Market Demand:**
- 180 pax: Regional (too small for target market)
- 200 pax: Marginal (not differentiated)
- **220 pax: Optimal (competitive sweet spot)**
- 250 pax: Large (limited routes)

**Competitive Position:**
- A321neo: 220 pax (narrow-body comfort)
- 787-8: 242 pax (wide-body comfort)
- **AMPEL360: 220 pax (wide-body comfort, lower cost)**

### Route Network

**Target Routes:**
- Trans-Atlantic: 3,500 NM (primary)
- Intra-Europe: 500-1,500 NM
- Intra-Asia: 1,000-2,500 NM
- US Transcontinental: 2,500 NM

**220 Pax Optimal:**
- Load factor: 85% target
- Frequency: Daily+ on major routes
- Economics: Break-even at 68% load
- Revenue: Optimal per flight

## Alternatives Considered

### 35m Width Option

**Advantages:**
- 3% lighter structure
- Slightly better aerodynamics (+1% L/D)
- Easier manufacturing

**Disadvantages:**
- Only 200 pax (10% capacity loss)
- Tighter cabin (8-abreast challenging)
- H₂ volume marginal (310 m³)
- Revenue potential reduced

**Decision:** Rejected (insufficient capacity)

### 42m Width Option

**Advantages:**
- 250 pax capacity
- Generous cabin space
- Ample H₂ volume (400 m³)

**Disadvantages:**
- 5% heavier structure (+1,300 kg)
- 1% aerodynamic penalty
- Special gates required (cost++)
- Manufacturing complexity higher
- Market demand uncertain

**Decision:** Rejected (excessive for market)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Manufacturing:** LOW
- Proven composite processes
- Standard tooling sizes
- Suppliers capable

**Certification:** LOW
- CS-25 requirements clear
- No novel technologies
- Precedents exist

**Operations:** LOW
- Airport compatibility confirmed
- Ground equipment available
- Training requirements manageable

### Business Risks

**Market Acceptance:** LOW
- 220 pax proven market size
- Wide-body comfort advantage
- Competitive operating costs

**Infrastructure:** LOW
- 87% airport compatibility
- Standard gates with adapters
- No major facility upgrades

## Final Decision Rationale

**38m width selected because:**

1. **Capacity:** 220 pax optimal for target market
2. **H₂ Integration:** 350 m³ provides adequate margin
3. **Structural:** Weight penalty acceptable vs 35m
4. **Aerodynamic:** No penalty vs narrower options
5. **Manufacturing:** Standard facilities compatible
6. **Operations:** 87% airport compatibility
7. **Economics:** Best business case
8. **Risk:** Low technical and business risk

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- Width ±1m: Minimal impact
- Width ±2m: Significant implications
- **38m robust to uncertainties**

## Validation

**Analysis Completed:**
- Passenger cabin mockup (full-scale section)
- H₂ tank integration study (detailed)
- Structural FEM (validated)
- Manufacturing process trials

**Results:**
- Cabin layout: Validated (220 pax comfortable)
- H₂ tanks: 4 × 33 m³ fit with margin
- Structure: Weight prediction accurate
- Manufacturing: Feasible with existing tools

## Baseline Control

**Configuration Management:**
- Width: 38.0m ±0.05m (tight tolerance)
- Change authority: CCB only
- Impact assessment: Required for any change
- Traceability: Full documentation
