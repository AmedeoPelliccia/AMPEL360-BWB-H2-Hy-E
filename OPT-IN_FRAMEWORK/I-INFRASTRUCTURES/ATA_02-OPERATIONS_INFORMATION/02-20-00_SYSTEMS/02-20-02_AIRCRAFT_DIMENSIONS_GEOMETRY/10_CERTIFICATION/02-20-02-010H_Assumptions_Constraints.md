# Assumptions & Constraints — 02-20-02

## Assumptions
- A-01: Geometry dataset is derived from approved design release X.Y. <!-- TODO: Replace "X.Y" with the actual approved design release version before finalization. -->
- A-02: Publication pipeline enforces iSpec/S1000D schemas & validations.

## Constraints
- C-01: Any geometry affecting operational minima requires CIA and re-issue.
- C-02: Only baselined data may be exported to operations manuals.
