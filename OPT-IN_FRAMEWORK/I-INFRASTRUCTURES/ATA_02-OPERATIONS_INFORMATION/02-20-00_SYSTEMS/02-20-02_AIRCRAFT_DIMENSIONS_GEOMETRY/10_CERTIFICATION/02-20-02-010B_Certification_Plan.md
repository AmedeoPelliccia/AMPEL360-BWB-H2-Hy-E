# Certification Plan — 02-20-02 Aircraft Dimensions & Geometry

## 1. Purpose & Scope
Plan the activities, artefacts, responsibilities and milestones to demonstrate compliance for *dimensions & geometry publications*.

## 2. Compliance Strategy
- **MoC**: Document Inspection, Analysis/Calculation traceable to design baselines, Process Audit (publication pipeline), and Consistency Reviews against iSpec/S1000D schemas.
- **Evidence**: Controlled source drawings/models references, CM logs, publication change records, review minutes, verification checklists.

## 3. Inputs / Outputs
- **Inputs**: Approved design geometry, SRD/RTM, interface specs, publication schemas, safety notes (if any).
- **Outputs**: Completed MoC index, compliance matrix, evidence set, conformity inspection reports, authority minutes.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Certification Lead (ATA 02)** — planning & authority liaison
- **Tech Pubs Lead** — iSpec/S1000D conformance
- **Design Authority** — geometry source approval & CM
- **Quality** — process audit, records integrity

## 5. Milestones
- CB approval of certification basis
- MoC allocation complete
- Evidence pack freeze (per issue)
- Conformity inspection completed
- Release to ops (EIS tag)

## 6. Configuration Management
All artefacts under Git CM with immutable hashes; issues tracked in GitHub; release tags mirrored in `XX-00-11_EIS_Versions_Tags`.
