# 10_CERTIFICATION — Aircraft Dimensions & Geometry (02-20-02)

**Purpose.** Collect the certification basis, means of compliance (MoC), evidence, and authority interactions for the *Aircraft Dimensions & Geometry* system under **ATA 02 – Operations Information**.

**Scope.**
- Regulatory basis (EASA/FAA) applicable to dimensions/markings in ab-initio operations documentation.
- MoC selection and allocation to requirements.
- Evidence register and conformity inspections planning.
- Authority engagement log and assumptions control.

**Dependencies.**
- `../02_SAFETY` (FHA/CCA links for OEB, if any)
- `../03_REQUIREMENTS` (SRD/RTM/RVCRM sources)
- `../05_INTERFACES` (publication interfaces, data formats, iSpec/S1000D)
- `../../02-00-00_GENERAL/XX-00-10_Certification/` (chapter-wide policies)

**Deliverables.**
- Certification Basis (`…010A_…`)
- Certification Plan (`…010B_…`)
- MoC Index (`…010C_…`)
- Compliance Matrix (`…010D_…`)
- Evidence Register (`…010E_…`)
- Conformity Inspection Plan (`…010F_…`)
- Authority Engagement Log (`…010G_…`)
- Assumptions & Constraints (`…010H_…`)
- CIA Template (`…010J_…`)

**Status.** Draft (structure established). Populate as analyses complete.

2. **Allocate MoCs** — Use `02-20-02-010C_Means_of_Compliance_Index.csv` to allocate MoCs by requirement.

3. **Build Compliance Matrix** — Populate `02-20-02-010D_Compliance_Matrix.csv` as requirements are addressed.

4. **Register Evidence** — Track all supporting documentation in `02-20-02-010E_Evidence_Register.csv` with locations and hashes.

5. **Execute Inspections** — Follow `02-20-02-010F_Conformity_Inspection_Plan.md` and record results.

6. **Track Authority Engagement** — Log all regulatory authority meetings in `02-20-02-010G_Authority_Engagement_Log.md`.

7. **Control Assumptions** — Maintain `02-20-02-010H_Assumptions_Constraints.md` as project evolves.
