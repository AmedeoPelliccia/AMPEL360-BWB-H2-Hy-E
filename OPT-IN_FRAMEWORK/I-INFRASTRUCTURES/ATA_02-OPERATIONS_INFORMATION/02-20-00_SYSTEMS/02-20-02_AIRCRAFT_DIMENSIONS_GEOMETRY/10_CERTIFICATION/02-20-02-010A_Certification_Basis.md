# Certification Basis — 02-20-02 Aircraft Dimensions & Geometry

## 1. Objectives
Define the regulatory and standards baseline applicable to *aircraft dimensions & geometry information* as published for operations, ground handling and infrastructure compatibility.

## 2. Applicable Regulations (to be refined)
- EASA: Part-21 processes (for document control context), CS-25 sections related to markings/placards & operational information alignment (cross-check), applicable AMC/GM as determined.
- FAA: 14 CFR Part 25 parallels as appropriate, ACs related to operations information/markings.
- Publication Standards: **ATA iSpec 2200**, **S1000D** for content structure and exchange.
- Program/Internal: AMPEL360 Documentation Standard; OPT-IN framework rules.

> NOTE: This system is information-centric under **ATA 02**; certification impact usually concerns **accuracy, consistency, and publication controls** rather than type design airworthiness features. Confirm with Certification Board.

## 3. Certification Assumptions
- Dimensions/geometry datasets are derived from approved design sources and baselined via CM.
- Any dimensional data used for operational clearances is traceable to qualified analyses or approved drawings.
- Changes to geometry that affect published operational limits trigger CIA and re-issue.

## 4. Outcomes
- Agreed list of clauses/paragraphs and guidance material.
- Mapping to program requirements and MoCs (see `…010C` and `…010D`).
