# 02-50-03_Communication_Infrastructure: Communication Infrastructure

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation for communication infrastructure structures including network cabling, antenna mounts, WiFi access points, and ground station infrastructure.

## Scope

Communication infrastructure includes:
- Physical network infrastructure (backbones, patch panels, equipment rooms)
- Cable routing principles (separation, shielding, redundancy)
- Antenna system mounts and locations
- WiFi access point physical deployment
- Ground station structural infrastructure
