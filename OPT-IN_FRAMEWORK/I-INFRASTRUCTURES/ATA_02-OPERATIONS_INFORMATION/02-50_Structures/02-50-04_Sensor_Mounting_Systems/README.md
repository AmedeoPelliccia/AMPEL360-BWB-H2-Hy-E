# 02-50-04: Sensor Mounting Systems

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation for sensor mounting systems used in operations and monitoring applications including temperature, pressure, environmental sensors, and LIDAR systems.

## Scope

Sensor mounting systems include:
- Sensor location strategy and coverage requirements
- Mounting bracket designs and load capacities
- Environmental protection (IP ratings, shields, housings)
- Maintenance access provisions
