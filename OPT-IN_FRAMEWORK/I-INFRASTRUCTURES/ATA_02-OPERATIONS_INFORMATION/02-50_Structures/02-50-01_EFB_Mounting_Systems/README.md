# 02-50-01: EFB Mounting Systems

## Purpose

This folder contains all documentation, designs, analyses, and test reports for Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) mounting systems in the cockpit of the AMPEL360 BWB H2-Hy-E aircraft. EFB mounts provide secure, ergonomic, and crash-load-certified mounting for pilot and copilot tablets/devices.

## Scope

EFB mounting systems include:
- Pilot-side and copilot-side EFB mounts
- Cockpit integration hardware and interfaces
- Structural and vibration analyses
- DO-160 and crash load certification testing
- Installation and maintenance procedures
