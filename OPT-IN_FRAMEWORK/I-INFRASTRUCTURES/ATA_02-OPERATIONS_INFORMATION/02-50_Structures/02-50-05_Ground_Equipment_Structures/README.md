# 02-50-05: Ground Equipment Structures

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation for ground support equipment structures including H₂ refueling infrastructure, GSE parking/mounting, loading equipment, and ground power units.

## Scope

Ground equipment structures include:
- GSE infrastructure (parking, guidance, safety areas)
- H₂ refueling structures (bowsers, stations, protection barriers, foundations)
- Loading equipment structural interfaces
- Ground power unit mounts and enclosures
