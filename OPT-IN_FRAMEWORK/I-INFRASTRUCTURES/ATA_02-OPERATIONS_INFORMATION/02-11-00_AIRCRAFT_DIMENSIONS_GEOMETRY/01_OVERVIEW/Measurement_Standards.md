# Measurement Standards

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-OVW-004  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Purpose

This document defines the measurement standards, procedures, and tolerances for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ aircraft dimensional control.

## Measurement Units

**Primary Units:**
- Length: meters (m)
- Area: square meters (m²)
- Volume: cubic meters (m³)
- Angle: degrees (°)
- Mass: kilograms (kg)

**Precision Standards:**
- Critical dimensions: 0.1 mm measurement accuracy
- Non-critical dimensions: 1.0 mm measurement accuracy
- Angular measurements: 0.1° accuracy

## Measurement Procedures

### Ground Measurement

**Equipment Required:**
- Laser measuring systems (±0.5 mm accuracy)
- Digital inclinometers (±0.1° accuracy)
- Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) for critical points
- Photogrammetry systems for large-scale measurements

**Environmental Conditions:**
- Temperature: 20°C ± 2°C
- Humidity: 50% ± 10% RH
- Atmospheric pressure: Standard (1013.25 hPa ± 5%)

### Reference Datum Establishment

**Primary Datum:**
- Nose apex at Station 0
- Ground plane at WL 0
- Centerline at BL 0

**Measurement Sequence:**
1. Establish ground datum plane
2. Set aircraft level (pitch and roll)
3. Identify nose apex reference point
4. Verify centerline symmetry
5. Measure all dimensions from established datums

## Tolerance Management

### Manufacturing Tolerances

| Dimension Type | Tolerance | Verification Method |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Overall dimensions | ±0.1 m | Laser measurement |
| Local dimensions | ±0.05 m | CMM or calipers |
| Surface contours | ±5 mm | Photogrammetry |
| Angular measurements | ±0.5° | Digital inclinometer |

### Operational Tolerances

**Thermal Expansion:**
- Aluminum structures: ±50 mm (temperature range -40°C to +50°C)
- Composite structures: ±20 mm (temperature range -40°C to +50°C)

**Load Deformation:**
- Wing droop at MTOW: +150 mm maximum
- Fuselage flexure: ±30 mm
- Landing gear compression: -200 mm

## Quality Control

**Inspection Frequency:**
- Initial manufacture: 100% dimensional inspection
- Pre-flight: Visual inspection of critical clearances
- Major maintenance: Full dimensional verification every 5 years
- Post-incident: Complete dimensional survey if damage suspected

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Measurement records retained for aircraft lifetime
- Digital 3D models updated after any structural modification
- Deviations from nominal dimensions tracked in aircraft logbook

## BWB-Specific Considerations

**Compound Curvature Measurement:**
- Use photogrammetry for continuous surface verification
- Minimum 100 measurement points per square meter for critical surfaces
- Surface deviation from CAD model: ±5 mm acceptable

**Symmetry Verification:**
- Left/right wing symmetry: ±10 mm maximum difference
- Center body symmetry: ±5 mm maximum difference
- Measurement at minimum 20 symmetry points

## Compliance

This measurement standard complies with:
- ISO 1101: Geometrical tolerancing
- AS9100D: Aerospace quality management
- EASA Part 21: Certification specifications
- ATA iSpec 2200: Documentation standards
