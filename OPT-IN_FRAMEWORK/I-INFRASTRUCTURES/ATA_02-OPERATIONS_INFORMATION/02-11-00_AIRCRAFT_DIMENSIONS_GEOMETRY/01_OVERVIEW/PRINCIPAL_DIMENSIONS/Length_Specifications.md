# Length Specifications

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-PRIN-003  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overall Length Definition

The overall length of the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ aircraft is the maximum longitudinal dimension from the forward-most point to the aft-most point.

### Primary Specification

**Overall Length:** 38.2 m ± 0.1 m

**Measurement Points:**
- Forward point: Nose apex (Station 0)
- Aft point: Trailing edge at centerline (Station 38.2)

## Length Breakdown by Section

### Longitudinal Sections

| Section | Station Range | Length | Description |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Nose Section** | STA 0 - STA 5 | 5.0 m | Radome, weather radar, nose gear |
| **Cockpit** | STA 5 - STA 10 | 5.0 m | Flight deck, forward crew area |
| **Forward Center Body** | STA 10 - STA 20 | 10.0 m | Forward passenger cabin, H₂ tank |
| **Mid Center Body** | STA 20 - STA 30 | 10.0 m | Main passenger cabin, wing spar |
| **Aft Center Body** | STA 30 - STA 35 | 5.0 m | Aft cabin, cargo, H₂ tank |
| **Tail Section** | STA 35 - STA 38.2 | 3.2 m | Aft pressure bulkhead to trailing edge |
| **Total Length** | **STA 0 - STA 38.2** | **38.2 m** | — |

## BWB-Specific Length Characteristics

### Comparison with Conventional Design

Unlike conventional aircraft where length is primarily fuselage-driven, the BWB length is determined by aerodynamic requirements:

| Aspect | BWB (AMPEL360) | Conventional (Similar Capacity) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Length-to-span ratio | 0.73 | 1.05 |
| Fuselage contribution to lift | 60% | 0% |
| Length driver | Aerodynamics | Passenger capacity |

### Chord Distribution

The BWB "length" varies significantly with lateral position due to the blended configuration:

**Centerline (BL 0):**
- Root chord: 35.0 m
- Leading edge: STA 3.2 m
- Trailing edge: STA 38.2 m

**Center Body Edge (BL ±19):**
- Local chord: 28.5 m
- Leading edge: STA 4.5 m
- Trailing edge: STA 33.0 m

**Wingtip (BL ±26):**
- Tip chord: 3.5 m
- Leading edge: STA 18.0 m
- Trailing edge: STA 21.5 m

### Mid Critical Stations

| Station | Location | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| STA 15 | 15.0 m | Center body maximum width |
| STA 18 | 18.0 m | Main landing gear centerline |
| STA 20 | 20.0 m | Forward H₂ tank center |
| STA 25 | 25.0 m | Wing center spar carrythrough |
| STA 30 | 30.0 m | Aft H₂ tank center |

### Aft Critical Stations

| Station | Location | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| STA 32 | 32.0 m | Aft cargo door |
| STA 35 | 35.0 m | Aft pressure bulkhead |
| STA 36 | 36.0 m | APU location |
| STA 38.2 | 38.2 m | Aft-most point (centerline TE) |

## Ground Operations

### Maneuvering Limitations

**Turning Radius (from nose):**
- Minimum turning radius: 42 m (centerline pivot)
- Nose swept path: 46 m radius
- Tail swept path: 44 m radius

**Parking Requirements:**
- Nose to obstacle: 3.0 m minimum
- Tail to obstacle: 3.0 m minimum
- Longitudinal parking space: 44.2 m (38.2 m + 6.0 m clearance)

### Towing and Pushback

**Tow Bar Attachment:**
- Station: STA 2.5 m (nose gear)
- Tow bar length: 6.0 m typical
- Towing speed: 5 knots maximum

**Pushback Clearances:**
- Straight pushback: 45 m minimum clearance behind
- Turning pushback: 50 m radius required

## Hangar and Maintenance

### Hangar Door Requirements

**Minimum Opening:**
- Width: 56 m (wingspan + clearance)
- Height: 16 m (height + clearance)
- Length access: 42 m door to allow entry

**Hangar Bay Depth:**
- Minimum: 45 m (38.2 m + clearance)
- Recommended: 50 m (for equipment access)

### Maintenance Access

**Jack Points:**
- Forward: STA 15 (main wing spar)
- Aft: STA 25 (aft wing spar)
- Spacing: 10 m (allows safe jacking)

## Measurement Procedures

**Measurement Method:**
1. Establish datum point at nose apex (STA 0)
2. Aircraft level (pitch within ±0.5°)
3. Laser measurement to aft-most point
4. Verify at centerline (BL 0)

**Verification Frequency:**
- Initial manufacture: Full measurement with CMM
- Annual inspection: Laser verification
- Post-incident: Full remeasurement if structural damage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Overall length: 38.2 m ± 0.1 m
- Nose to aft pressure bulkhead: 35.0 m ± 0.05 m
- Critical station locations: ±0.05 m

## Regulatory Compliance

**EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25:**
- Subpart B: Flight performance calculations use reference length
- Subpart C: Structure considers length-driven loads
- Subpart D: Design considers evacuation time (function of length)

**Airport Compatibility:**
- Code 4 (> 1800m field length required)
- Compatible with all major airports
- No special gate length restrictions
