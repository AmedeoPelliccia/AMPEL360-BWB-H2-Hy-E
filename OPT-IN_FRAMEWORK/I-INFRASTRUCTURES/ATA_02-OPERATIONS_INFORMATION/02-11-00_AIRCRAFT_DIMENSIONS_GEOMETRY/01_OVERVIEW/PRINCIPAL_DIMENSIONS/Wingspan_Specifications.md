# Wingspan Specifications

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-PRIN-002  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Wingspan Definition

The wingspan of the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ aircraft is the maximum distance between the extreme lateral points of the aircraft, measured wingtip to wingtip.

### Primary Specification

**Wingspan:** 52.0 m ± 0.1 m

**Measurement Points:**
- Left wingtip: BL -26.0 m
- Right wingtip: BL +26.0 m
- Measurement includes winglet extremities

## Wingspan Components

### Main Wing Section

| Section | Span (per side) | Buttline Range | Description |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Center Body | 19.0 m | BL 0 to BL ±19 | Pressurized fuselage/wing blend |
| Mid Wing | 5.0 m | BL ±19 to BL ±24 | Transition section |
| Outer Wing | 2.0 m | BL ±24 to BL ±26 | Pure aerodynamic surface |
| **Total (each side)** | **26.0 m** | **BL 0 to BL ±26** | — |

### Winglet Geometry

**Winglet Height:** 3.5 m  
**Cant Angle:** 75° from horizontal  
**Toe-in Angle:** 2°  
**Sweep Angle:** 35° (leading edge)

**Winglet Benefits:**
- 8% reduction in induced drag
- Improved climb performance
- Better fuel efficiency
- Reduced wingtip vortices

## BWB-Specific Characteristics

### Effective Span Efficiency

Due to the blended wing body configuration, the AMPEL360 achieves higher span efficiency than conventional aircraft:

**Oswald Efficiency Factor (e):** 0.85 (vs 0.75 typical conventional)

This results in:
- Lower induced drag
- Better high-altitude performance
- Improved range and endurance

### Aspect Ratio

**Aspect Ratio (AR):** 3.2

**Calculation:**
```
AR = b² / S
AR = 52.0² / 845
AR = 2704 / 845
AR = 3.2
```

**Comparison:**
- BWB typical: 3.0 - 3.5
- Conventional narrow-body: 9.0 - 11.0
- Conventional wide-body: 8.0 - 10.0

Note: BWB aspect ratios are lower because the entire fuselage contributes to lift.

## Aerodynamic Considerations

### Span Loading

**Average Span Loading:** 16.25 kg/m per meter of span (at MTOW)

**Calculation:**
```
Span Loading = MTOW / b
Span Loading = 85,000 kg / 52.0 m
Span Loading = 1,635 kg/m
```

### Bending Moment Distribution

**Root Bending Moment:** Lower than conventional due to distributed lift

**Advantages:**
- Reduced structural weight
- More efficient load paths
- Lower wing box stress

## Ground Operations

### Taxiway Width Requirements

**ICAO Code E Requirements:**
- Minimum taxiway width: 23 m
- Taxiway edge to object clearance: 9.25 m
- Total cleared width: 41.5 m

**Actual Clearance:**
- Aircraft wingspan: 52.0 m
- Minimum safe clearance: 56.0 m cleared width
- Safety margin: 2.0 m per side

### Apron and Gate Compatibility

**Stand Requirements:**
- Aircraft parking stand width: 60 m minimum
- Wingtip to wingtip clearance (adjacent aircraft): 7.5 m minimum
- Wingtip to building clearance: 4.0 m minimum

**Compatible Gates:**
- Wide-body gates (Group V/VI)
- All Boeing 777/787 gates
- All Airbus A350 gates
- Most Boeing 747 gates (with restrictions)

## Regulatory Compliance

### ICAO Annex 14

**Aerodrome Reference Code:** 4E
- Number 4: Field length ≥ 1800 m
- Letter E: Wingspan 52m to 65m

### FAA Advisory Circulars

**AC 150/5300-13A:** Airport Design
- Runway width: 45 m minimum
- Runway to taxiway centerline separation: 176 m
- Taxiway to taxiway centerline separation: 97.5 m

## Measurement Verification

**Measurement Method:**
- Laser distance measurement from centerline to each wingtip
- Aircraft level (pitch and roll within ±0.5°)
- Landing gear extended
- No load on wings (fuel empty)

**Verification Frequency:**
- Initial manufacture: Full measurement
- Annual inspection: Visual verification
- Post-incident: Full remeasurement if wing damage

**Tolerance Acceptance:**
- Left-right symmetry: ±10 mm maximum difference
- Overall span: 52.0 m ± 100 mm
