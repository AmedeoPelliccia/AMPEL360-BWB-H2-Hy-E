**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-TRADE-005  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Trade Study Overview

**Objective:** Balance ground clearance requirements with landing gear weight and complexity.

## Options Evaluated

| Gear Height | Wingtip Clear | Belly Clear | Gear Weight | Complexity | Score |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 2.5m | 2.1m | 0.5m | -12% | Low | 68 |
| 2.8m | 2.4m | 0.6m | -5% | Low | 75 |
| **3.2m** | **2.8m** | **0.8m** | **Baseline** | **Moderate** | **95** |
| 3.6m | 3.2m | 1.0m | +8% | High | 82 |
| 4.0m | 3.6m | 1.2m | +15% | High | 70 |

## Key Trade-offs

### Ground Clearance Benefits

**Operational Safety:**
- Higher clearance: More margin for errors
- Reduced strike risk: Safer operations
- Uneven surfaces: Better tolerance

**Maintenance:**
- Access: Improved (higher belly)
- Inspection: Easier visibility
- Service: Better positioning

### Landing Gear Weight Penalty

**Weight Increase:**
- Strut length: Primary driver
- Structure: Supporting loads
- Retraction mechanism: Complexity

**Per Meter Height Increase:**
- Main gear: +180 kg each
- Nose gear: +45 kg
- Total: +405 kg per meter

## Analysis: 3.2m Selection

### Clearance Margins

**Wingtip (2.8m static):**
- CS-25 minimum: 0.5m
- Design margin: 2.3m (460%)
- **EXCELLENT safety margin**

**Belly (0.8m minimum):**
- CS-25 minimum: ~0.2m (typical)
- Design margin: 0.6m (300%)
- **GOOD safety margin**

**Tail (15° attitude):**
- Clearance: 0.3m
- CS-25 minimum: Positive
- Margin: 200mm
- **ADEQUATE with tail skid**

### Weight Impact

**Landing Gear System:**
- Main gear: 3,200 kg (2 units)
- Nose gear: 580 kg
- Total: 3,780 kg

**Alternative Comparisons:**
- 2.8m gear: 3,590 kg (-190 kg, 5%)
- 3.6m gear: 4,100 kg (+320 kg, 8%)

**Mission Impact (3.2m baseline):**
- OEW: 95,000 kg
- Gear: 4.0% of OEW
- Fuel penalty: Minimal
- Range impact: <1%

## Operational Considerations

### Airport Compatibility

**Pavement Strength:**
- PCN requirement: 80
- Gear load: Within limits
- 3.2m height: No impact on PCN

**Ground Operations:**
- Servicing: Standard equipment
- Towing: Dual towbar (manageable)
- Maintenance: Good access

### Safety Margins

**Normal Operations:**
- Taxi: Safe (CAOS monitoring)
- Takeoff: No strike risk
- Landing: Adequate sink rate tolerance

**Abnormal Conditions:**
- Hard landing: 3.6 m/s (protected)
- Crosswind: 38 knots (adequate clearance)
- Uneven surface: ±3° pitch/roll (safe)

## Alternative Analysis

### 2.8m Gear Height

**Advantages:**
- Weight: -5% (190 kg lighter)
- Simplicity: Less retraction complexity
- Cost: Lower manufacturing cost

**Disadvantages:**
- Wingtip clearance: Only 2.4m (marginal)
- Belly clearance: Only 0.6m (tight)
- Safety margin: Reduced
- Operational risk: Higher

**Decision:** REJECTED (insufficient margin)

### 3.6m Gear Height

**Advantages:**
- Wingtip clearance: 3.2m (excellent)
- Belly clearance: 1.0m (excellent)
- Safety margin: Maximum
- Maintenance access: Best

**Disadvantages:**
- Weight: +8% (320 kg heavier)
- Complexity: Higher retraction system
- Cost: +12% landing gear cost
- Mission performance: -1.2% range

**Decision:** REJECTED (excessive weight penalty)

## Validation

**Ground Tests:**
- Full-scale mockup: All clearances verified
- Gear stroke: Measured (matches predictions)
- Dynamic loads: Validated

**Analysis:**
- FEM: Gear loads and structure
- Kinematic: Retraction cycle
- Clearance: All attitudes checked

**Flight Test (Planned):**
- Taxi operations: Various conditions
- Takeoff/landing: Sink rate validation
- Crosswind: Maximum demonstrated

## Final Decision

**3.2m landing gear height selected because:**

1. **Safety:** Adequate clearance margins (300-460%)
2. **Weight:** Acceptable penalty (baseline)
3. **Operations:** Compatible with procedures
4. **Maintenance:** Good access for servicing
5. **Cost:** Reasonable gear system cost
6. **Risk:** Proven gear technology
7. **Certification:** CS-25 compliant

**Key Factors:**
- Wingtip clearance: 2.8m (adequate)
- Belly clearance: 0.8m (good)
- Weight: 3,780 kg (acceptable)
- Safety margins: Meet enhanced targets

**Sensitivity:**
- ±0.2m: Minimal impact
- ±0.5m: Significant (requires analysis)
