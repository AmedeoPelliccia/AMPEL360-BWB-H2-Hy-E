# Planform Evolution

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-PF-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Evolution Timeline

### 2023 Q1: Initial Concept
- Pure BWB configuration selected
- Initial wingspan: 60m (AR 4.0)
- Straight leading edge (35° sweep)
- Simple elliptical planform

**Issues Identified:**
- Airport compatibility limited (Code F)
- Manufacturing complexity high
- Structural weight excessive

### 2023 Q2: First Refinement
- Wingspan reduced to 56m (AR 3.7)
- Compound leading edge curve introduced
- Wing root blend optimization
- Improved lift distribution

**Improvements:**
- Better Code E/F borderline
- Reduced structural loads
- Improved aerodynamics (+5% L/D)

### 2023 Q3: Airport Compatibility Focus
- Wingspan further reduced to 52m (AR 3.2)
- Leading edge sweep optimized to 37°
- Trailing edge sweep varied (outer wing)
- Wingtip design refined

**Achievements:**
- Code E compliance achieved
- 87% airport compatibility
- L/D maintained at 21
- Manufacturing feasibility confirmed

### 2023 Q4: Detail Optimization
- Center body blending refined
- Chord distribution optimized
- Control surface integration
- Structural load path optimization

**Final Configuration:**
- Wingspan: 52.0m
- Wing area: 845m²
- Aspect ratio: 3.2
- LE sweep: 37° (average)
- TE sweep: Variable (-12° to 0°)

### 2024: Validation Phase
- Wind tunnel testing (1:10 scale)
- CFD validation (10M+ cells)
- Manufacturing trials (sections)
- Ground handling simulation

**Results:**
- Performance targets met
- Manufacturing validated
- Certification path clear
- Production frozen

## Key Design Decisions

### Planform Shape Selection
**Options Considered:**
1. Elliptical planform (theoretical optimum)
2. Trapezoidal with blended center
3. **Compound curve (selected)**
4. Delta-like configuration

**Selection Rationale:**
- Optimal lift distribution
- Structural efficiency
- Manufacturing practicality
- Control surface integration

### Aspect Ratio Trade-off
**Evolution:**
- Initial: AR 4.0 (60m span)
- Intermediate: AR 3.7 (56m span)
- **Final: AR 3.2 (52m span)**

**Trade-off Acceptance:**
- -5% aerodynamic efficiency vs AR 4.0
- +50% airport compatibility
- -15% structural weight vs AR 4.0
- Net benefit: POSITIVE

### Sweep Angle Optimization
**Analysis:**
- 30°: Insufficient for M0.82
- 35°: Marginal compressibility margin
- **37°: Selected (optimal)**
- 40°: Excessive structural penalty

**Benefits of 37°:**
- M0.82 cruise capability
- Natural laminar flow potential
- Acceptable structural weight
- Good high-lift characteristics

## Planform Validation

**Aerodynamic:**
- L/D = 21.0 achieved
- Stall progression smooth
- Control authority adequate
- High-lift system effective

**Structural:**
- Wing box weight: 18,500 kg
- Load path efficiency: 92%
- Fatigue life: 60,000 cycles
- Damage tolerance verified

**Operational:**
- Ground clearance adequate
- Taxi operations validated
- Maintenance access confirmed
- Production tooling ready

## Future Considerations

**Potential Improvements:**
- Adaptive wingtip devices
- Load alleviation systems
- Advanced high-lift devices
- Morphing structures (long-term)
