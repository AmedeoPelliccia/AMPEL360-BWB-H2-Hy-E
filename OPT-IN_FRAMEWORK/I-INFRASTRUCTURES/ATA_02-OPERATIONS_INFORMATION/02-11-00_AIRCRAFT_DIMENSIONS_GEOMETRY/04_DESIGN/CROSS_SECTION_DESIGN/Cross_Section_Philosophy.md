**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-DES-CS-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## BWB Cross-Section Design Approach

### Fundamental Principle

**Unlike conventional aircraft with circular fuselage cross-sections, the BWB features continuously varying cross-sections optimized for:**
- Aerodynamic efficiency (airfoil shapes)
- Structural efficiency (pressure vessel)
- Volume utilization (passenger/cargo/systems)
- Load distribution (wing-body integration)

## Cross-Section Evolution

### Nose Section (Station 0-5m)

**Shape:** Sharp aerodynamic nose transitioning to pressure vessel

**Characteristics:**
- Width: 2m → 15m
- Height: 2m → 5m
- T/C ratio: 8% → 12%
- Purpose: Low drag, avionics bay, cockpit

### Forward Body (Station 5-12m)

**Shape:** Airfoil with double-bubble pressure vessel

**Characteristics:**
- Width: 15m → 32m
- Height: 5m → 8m
- T/C ratio: 12% → 14%
- Purpose: Flight deck, forward cabin, nose gear

### Center Body Maximum (Station 12-20m)

**Shape:** Thick airfoil with maximum volume

**Characteristics:**
- Width: 32m → 38m (maximum)
- Height: 8m → 8.5m (maximum)
- T/C ratio: 14% → 15% (maximum)
- Purpose: Main passenger cabin, H₂ tanks, main gear

### Aft Body (Station 20-28.5m)

**Shape:** Airfoil taper to wing blend

**Characteristics:**
- Width: 38m → 26m
- Height: 8.5m → 4m
- T/C ratio: 15% → 9%
- Purpose: Aft cabin, galleys, APU, tail cone

## Design Methodology

### Aerodynamic Shaping

**Upper Surface:**
- Smooth contour for laminar flow
- H₂ tanks faired into surface
- Minimal excrescences
- Natural flow acceleration

**Lower Surface:**
- Pressure recovery optimization
- Cargo door integration
- Landing gear fairings
- Structural efficiency

### Structural Integration

**Pressure Vessel:**
- Double-bubble configuration
- Efficient hoop stress distribution
- Frame spacing: 0.6m
- Stringer pitch: 0.2m

**Wing Box Integration:**
- Continuous structure (no joint)
- Multiple load paths
- Distributed attachments
- Optimal depth distribution

### Volume Optimization

**Pressurized Space:**
- Passenger cabin: 2.1m height
- Cargo holds: LD3-45 compatible
- Systems bays: As required
- Total: 1,850 m³

**Non-Pressurized:**
- H₂ tanks: 350 m³ (upper deck)
- Landing gear wells: 150 m³
- Systems: 300 m³

## Key Design Decisions

### Double-Bubble Pressure Vessel

**Selected Configuration:**
- Upper bubble: 20m wide × 4.2m high
- Lower bubble: 36m wide × 4.3m high
- Central flat section: Structural efficiency

**Benefits:**
- Efficient pressure containment
- Optimal space utilization
- H₂ tank separation
- Reduced structural weight vs single bubble

### Maximum T/C Ratio: 15%

**Rationale:**
- Structural depth adequate (2.8m wing box)
- Aerodynamic efficiency maintained
- Volume sufficient for all systems
- Manufacturing feasible

### Continuous Variation

**No Discontinuities:**
- Smooth transitions (aerodynamics)
- Distributed loads (structure)
- Progressive manufacturing
- Assembly simplification

## Validation

**CFD Analysis:**
- 50+ cross-sections modeled
- Pressure distributions validated
- L/D contributions calculated
- Interference effects minimized

**Structural Testing:**
- Full-scale pressure test
- Ultimate load: 1.5x design
- Fatigue: 180,000 cycles
- Damage tolerance verified

**Manufacturing Trials:**
- Composite layup validated
- Tool design confirmed
- Quality achievable
- Production rate demonstrated

## Future Optimization

**Potential Improvements:**
- Active shape control
- Load-adaptive structure
- Advanced materials
- Manufacturing automation

**Status:** Design frozen (2024-04-01)  
**Change Control:** CCB required
