# Oversize Aircraft Procedures

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-034  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB exceeds standard aircraft dimensions in multiple categories, requiring special operational procedures and airport coordination. This document addresses procedures specific to oversize aircraft operations.

## Dimensional Classification

### AMPEL360 BWB Dimensions

**Critical Dimensions:**
- Wingspan: 52m (ICAO Code E, approaching Code F)
- Center body width: 38m (exceptional)
- Overall length: 36m (moderate)
- Height: 12m (moderate)

**ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code:**
- Code Letter: E (wingspan 52-65m)
- Code Number: 4 (length ≥45m) - but only 36m length
- **Classification: Code 4E** (by wingspan)

### Comparison to Standard Aircraft

| Aircraft | Wingspan | Length | Width | Code |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|------|
| B737-800 | 35.8m | 39.5m | 3.8m | 3C |
| A320-200 | 35.8m | 37.6m | 4.0m | 3C |
| B777-300ER | 64.8m | 73.9m | 6.2m | 4E/F |
| A380-800 | 79.8m | 72.7m | 7.1m | 4F |
| **AMPEL360 BWB** | **52m** | **36m** | **38m** | **4E** |

**Unique Aspect:** Center body width (38m) is unprecedented

## Airport Compatibility

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Taxiways:**
- Minimum width: 23m (Code E standard)
- Preferred width: 30m+ (enhanced operations)
- Edge clearance: 4.5m each side (standard)
- AMPEL360 requires: ~5m clearance each side (wider caution)

**Gates:**
- Standard widebody gate: 8-10m accommodation
- AMPEL360 requirement: 28m minimum clear width
- Multiple jetways: Typically 4-6 required
- Specialized gate design or adapters mandatory

**Runways:**
- Code E minimum: 45m width
- AMPEL360 operations: Standard Code E runways suitable
- Centerline tracking: Critical (wingspan considerations)

**Aprons:**
- Parking spot: 60m × 70m minimum
- Adjacent aircraft separation: 15m minimum (wingtip to wingtip)
- Ground service area: 800m² required

### Airport Certification

**Requirements for AMPEL360 Operations:**
1. Code E infrastructure (minimum)
2. BWB-specific gate capability (or adapters)
3. H₂ refueling infrastructure
4. Trained ground handling personnel
5. Emergency response capability (H₂ incidents)

**Certification Process:**
1. Airport assessment and survey
2. Infrastructure verification
3. Procedure development (airport-specific)
4. Ground personnel training
5. Familiarization operations
6. Operational approval

## Special Operational Procedures

### Route Planning

**Airport Selection:**
- Code E minimum capability
- BWB gate compatibility
- H₂ infrastructure availability
- Ground handling capability
- Weather (wind limits due to large planform)

**Alternate Airports:**
- Same criteria as primary
- Pre-coordination recommended
- Crew familiarization required

**NOTAM Review:**
- Taxiway restrictions (width, construction)
- Gate availability
- Equipment availability (jetways, stairs)
- Special procedures or restrictions

### Pre-Flight Planning

**Airport Familiarization:**
- Airport diagram review
- Gate location and configuration
- Taxi routes (suitable taxiways identified)
- Hold positions and clearances
- Emergency procedures (airport-specific)

**Weather Considerations:**
- Crosswind limits: 35 kt taxi, 38 kt takeoff/landing
- Visibility minimums: Standard, but enhanced for taxiing
- Wind forecast: Ground operations sensitive (large planform area)

**Coordination:**
- Airport operations: AMPEL360 arrival notification
- Ground handling: Service readiness verification
- ATC: Special procedures briefing (if any)
- H₂ refueling: Availability confirmation

### Taxi Procedures

**General:**
- Standard procedures (clearance, route, speed)
- Enhanced clearance awareness (wingspan)
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous
- Wing walkers: As required (tight clearances)

**Communications:**
- Standard ATC phraseology
- Additional: "BWB" or "Code E, heavy" for awareness
- Request progressive taxi if unfamiliar with airport
- Coordinate with ground for gate entry

**Restrictions:**
- Taxiways: Only Code E (23m+) or approved narrower with procedures
- Intersections: Verify clearances (especially angled intersections)
- Hold lines: Enhanced awareness (wingspan considerations)

### Gate Operations

**Approach:**
- Coordination with ground operations coordinator
- Nose gear centerline alignment critical
- Speed: 5 kt maximum
- Wing walkers: Standard (both wingtips)
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous

**Parking:**
- Precision stop position: ±0.5m tolerance
- Clearance verification: Visual, CAOS, wing walkers
- Chocks and brakes: Standard
- Jetway approach coordination: Multiple units

**Service Operations:**
- Ground operations coordinator: Mandatory
- Multiple service vehicles: Coordinated approach
- H₂ refueling: Special procedures (50m exclusion zone)
- Turnaround time: 45 minutes standard (efficient coordination)

### Departure:**

**Engine Start:**
- Standard procedures
- Area clearance: Enhanced (wide aircraft, multiple service positions)
- Communication: All service vehicles and personnel

**Pushback/Towing:**
- Tug capability: Verify (185,000 kg MTOW)
- Tow bar: Dual attachment (BL ±5m)
- Clearances: Verified by ground coordinator and wing walkers
- Speed: 5 kt maximum

**Taxi:**
- Route: Pre-planned, suitable taxiways
