# Ground Attitude Limits

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-033  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB aircraft has specific ground attitude limits to ensure adequate clearances and prevent structural contact with the ground. This document defines these limits and associated operational procedures.

## Attitude Definitions

### Pitch Attitude (Longitudinal)

**Level Attitude (Reference):**
- Definition: Aircraft on level surface, landing gear properly extended
- Fuselage reference line (FRL): 0° relative to ground
- Nose gear properly inflated and extended
- Main gear properly inflated and extended

**Pitch Up (Nose Up):**
- Positive pitch angle
- Aft fuselage clearance decreases
- Forward clearance increases

**Pitch Down (Nose Down):**
- Negative pitch angle
- Aft fuselage clearance increases
- Forward clearance decreases

### Roll Attitude (Lateral)

**Level Attitude (Reference):**
- Wings level relative to ground
- Equal wingtip clearances (left and right)

**Roll (Bank):**
- One wingtip lower than the other
- Low-side wingtip clearance decreases

## Ground Attitude Limits

### Static Conditions (Aircraft at Rest)

**Pitch Limits:**
- Maximum pitch up: +5° (aft clearance limit)
- Maximum pitch down: -3° (nose gear limit)
- Normal variation: ±1° (acceptable)

**Roll Limits:**
- Maximum roll: ±3° (wingtip clearance limit)
- Normal variation: ±1° (acceptable, wind effects)

**Critical Clearances at Limits:**
- Pitch +5°: Aft fuselage clearance ~1.0m
- Roll ±3°: Low wingtip clearance ~0.9m (MTOW)

### Dynamic Conditions (Aircraft Moving)

**Taxi Operations:**
- Maximum pitch: ±2° (normal operations)
- Maximum roll: ±3° (crosswind/uneven surface)
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous

**Takeoff Rotation:**
- Rotation rate: 3-5°/sec (standard)
- Maximum pitch: 12° (tail strike protection)
- Clearance at 12° pitch: 0.5m minimum (aft)

**Landing Flare:**
- Maximum pitch: 10° (tail strike protection)
- Touchdown attitude: 7-8° (normal)

## Factors Affecting Ground Attitude

### Aircraft Weight

**Effect on Clearances:**
- MTOW (185,000 kg): Minimum clearances
- MLW (150,000 kg): +0.1-0.2m improvement
- OEW (90,000 kg): +0.3m improvement
- Fuel load: Proportional effect

**Landing Gear Compression:**
- MTOW: Maximum compression (lowest aircraft)
- Lighter weight: Increased clearances
- Tire deflection: Weight-dependent

### Loading and CG

**CG Position:**
- Forward CG: Nose-down tendency
- Aft CG: Tail-down tendency (critical for tail clearance)
- CG limits: Defined in loading manual

**Load Distribution:**
- Passenger distribution
- Cargo distribution
- Fuel distribution
- Effect on aircraft attitude

### Surface Conditions

**Level Surface:**
- Reference condition
- Nominal clearances
- Standard procedures

**Sloped Surface:**
- Upslope: Effective nose-up pitch
- Downslope: Effective nose-down pitch
- Lateral slope: Roll effect
- Clearance adjustments required

**Uneven Surface:**
- Landing gear struts at different compressions
- Pitch and roll variations
- CAOS monitoring critical
- Speed restrictions

### Environmental Factors

**Wind Effects:**
- Crosswind: Roll tendency
- Increased ground roll (landing gear compression changes)
- Aircraft weathervaning

**Temperature:**
- Tire pressure variations
- Strut pneumatic pressure changes
- Clearance effects (typically minor, <10mm)

## Monitoring Systems

### CAOS Ground Attitude Monitoring

**Inputs:**
- Inertial measurement units (pitch, roll)
- Landing gear position sensors
- Gross weight calculation (fuel quantity)
- Temperature sensors

**Calculations:**
- Real-time attitude determination
- Clearance calculations (wingtip, belly, tail)
- Limit comparisons
- Alert generation

**Outputs:**
- Crew displays (attitude, clearances)
- Alert messages (limits approached/exceeded)
- Data recording (analysis)

### Crew Displays

**Primary Flight Display (PFD):**
- Pitch attitude indication
- Roll attitude indication (if excessive)
- CAOS ground clearance advisory

**Crew Alerting System (CAS):**
- Caution: Attitude limits approached
- Warning: Attitude limits exceeded
- Ground clearance warnings

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Check

**Verification:**
1. Aircraft on level surface (visual/instruments)
2. CAOS ground mode activated
3. Gross weight verification
4. Clearance calculations normal

**Abnormal Conditions:**
- Sloped parking spot: Note attitude, adjust procedures
- Uneven surface: Evaluate clearances, proceed with caution
- Excessive wind: Monitor for roll tendency

### Taxi Procedures

**Standard:**
- Monitor attitude (CAOS displays)
- Speed limits: 20 kt straight, 10 kt turns
- Avoid abrupt maneuvers (pitch/roll excursions)

**Rough Surfaces:**
- Reduced speed: 10 kt or less
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous
- Expect pitch/roll variations

**Sloped Taxiways:**
- Upslope: Effective nose-up, tail clearance caution
- Downslope: Effective nose-down, normal
- Speed: Reduced as appropriate

### Parking Procedures

**Spot Selection:**
- Level surface preferred
- Maximum slope: 2% (1.1°)
- Uneven surface: Avoid if possible

**Parking:**
- Final position verification (clearances adequate)
- Chocks and brakes
- Attitude monitoring until shutdown

## Special Considerations

### Jacking Operations

**Attitude Control:**
- Jacking procedure: Aft jacks first, then forward
- Level attitude maintenance: Critical
- Maximum jacking attitude variation: ±0.5°

### Maintenance Operations

**Landing Gear Servicing:**
- Strut servicing: Attitude changes expected
- Tire pressure: Effects on attitude and clearances
- Post-service verification: Attitude and clearances

### Towing Operations

**Tow Bar Attachment:**
- Level attitude preferred
- Nose gear extension and compression normal
- Pitch attitude monitoring during tow

**Towing:**
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Avoid pitch/roll excursions
- Monitor clearances continuously
