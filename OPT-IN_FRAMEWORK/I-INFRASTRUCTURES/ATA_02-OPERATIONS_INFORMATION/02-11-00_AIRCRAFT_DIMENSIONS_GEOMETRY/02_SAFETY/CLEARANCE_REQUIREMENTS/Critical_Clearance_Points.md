**Risk Category:** HIGH

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Pre-taxi pavement inspection
- CAOS ground clearance calculation
- Crew warning system (<1.5m)
- Speed restrictions on uneven surfaces

**Threat Scenarios:**
- Pavement irregularities
- Taxiway center lights (raised)

- Drainage covers and utility access

### 3. Engine Intake Height

**Location:** STA 30m, BL ±8m  
**Critical Clearance:** 2.8m (static)  
**Risk Category:** MEDIUM (FOD risk)

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- FOD walk-down procedures
- Intake protection during ground ops
- Wind direction monitoring
- Intake covers when parked

**Threat Scenarios:**
- FOD ingestion during taxi
- Ground crew equipment
- Debris from adjacent operations
- Bird strikes (ground)

### 4. Refueling Panel Access

**Location:** STA 22m, BL ±10m (H₂ panels)  
**Critical Clearance:** 1.8m minimum  
**Risk Category:** CRITICAL (H₂ safety)

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- 50m safety zone enforcement
- Ground bonding verification
- Fire suppression positioning
- Windward approach only

**Threat Scenarios:**
- Ignition sources
- Static discharge
- Equipment collision
- Personnel access

### 5. Door Thresholds

**Location:** Multiple (6 Type A, 6 Type III)  
**Critical Clearance:** 0.5-0.6m (jetway/stairs)  
**Risk Category:** MEDIUM (operational)

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Jetway alignment verification
- Stairs positioning checks
- Door sill protection
- Weather considerations

**Threat Scenarios:**
- Jetway misalignment
- Stairs instability
- Passenger injury
- Door damage

## Secondary Critical Points

### Landing Gear Clearances

**Main Gear:**
- Minimum pavement clearance: 0.4m
- Tire protection from debris
- Wheel well clearance during retraction

**Nose Gear:**
- Steering clearance envelope
- Tow bar attachment clearance
- Camera/sensor protection

### Cargo Door Clearances

**Forward Cargo (STA 12m):**
- Loader positioning: 1.0m clearance
- Door swing clearance: 2.5m radius
- Ground equipment approach path

**Aft Cargo (STA 26m):**
- Loader positioning: 1.0m clearance
- Fuel panel proximity consideration
- H₂ safety zone awareness

## CAOS Integration

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- 3D clearance envelope calculation
- Ground proximity warnings
- Predictive collision alerts
- Crew advisory display

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Red: <minimum clearance
- Amber: <minimum + 0.3m
- Green: Normal operations

**Data Sources:**
- Landing gear position sensors
- Fuel quantity (weight calculation)
- Ground speed and acceleration
- Aircraft attitude (pitch/roll)

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Checks

1. CAOS ground mode activation
2. Clearance calculation verification
3. Wing walker assignment (if required)
4. Route clearance confirmation

### During Taxi

1. Continuous CAOS monitoring
2. Speed restrictions (clearance-dependent)
3. Wing walker communication
4. Marshaller coordination

### Parking and Service

1. Final position clearance check
2. Chock placement verification
3. Service equipment clearance
4. H₂ refueling safety zone establishment

## Training Requirements

**Flight Crew:**
- CAOS ground mode operation
- Clearance limitation awareness
- Emergency stop procedures

**Ground Crew:**
- Wing walker certification
- Marshalling procedures (BWB-specific)
- Clearance zone recognition
- Equipment positioning standards

**Maintenance Personnel:**

- Jacking procedure safety
- Protective equipment usage
- Incident reporting

## Documentation and Reporting

**Clearance Incidents:**
- Any contact or near-miss
- CAOS alert activation
- Pavement condition issues
- Equipment positioning violations

**Reporting Chain:**
- Immediate: Ground operations supervisor
- 24 hours: Safety department
- 7 days: Root cause analysis
- 30 days: Corrective action implementation
