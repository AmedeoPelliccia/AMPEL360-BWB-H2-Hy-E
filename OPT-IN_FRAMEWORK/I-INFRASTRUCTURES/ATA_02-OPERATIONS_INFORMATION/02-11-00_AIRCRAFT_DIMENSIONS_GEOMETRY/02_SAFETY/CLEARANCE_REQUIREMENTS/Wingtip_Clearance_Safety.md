# Wingtip Clearance Safety

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-012  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB aircraft features a 52m wingspan, requiring special attention to wingtip clearance during all ground operations. This document defines safety requirements and procedures for wingtip clearance management.

## Critical Dimensions

### Static Clearances (Aircraft at Rest)

**At MTOW (185,000 kg):**
- Wingtip height: 1.2m ± 0.1m above ground
- Lateral position: BL ±26m from centerline
- Total wingspan coverage: 52m

**At MLW (150,000 kg):**
- Wingtip height: 1.4m (increased clearance)
- Wing flex reduction: ~100mm
- Improved clearance margin

### Dynamic Clearances (Aircraft Moving)

**During Taxi:**
- Minimum maintained clearance: 1.0m
- Maximum lateral attitude: ±3°
- Roll due to crosswind: Considered in CAOS calculations

**During Turns:**
- Inside wingtip critical
- Minimum turning radius: 42m (wingtip to centerline)
- Speed restriction: 10 kt maximum

## Hazard Scenarios

### Taxiway Operations

**Narrow Taxiways:**
- Minimum width required: 23m (ICAO Code E)
- Edge margin: 1.5m minimum each side
- Visual references: Edge lights, markings

**Taxiway Intersections:**
- Complex geometry considerations
- Multiple potential conflict points
- Enhanced clearance monitoring required

**Signs and Lights:**
- Taxiway edge lights: Low profile required
- Signs: Frangible construction, set back >5m
- Ground markings: <5mm thickness

### Gate Operations

**Jetway/Bridge Conflicts:**
- Retracted position clearance: 3m minimum
- Extended position: Route clearance verification
- Movement coordination required

**Adjacent Aircraft:**
- Wingtip-to-wingtip separation: 8m minimum
- Parking spot geometry critical
- Visual alignment verification

**Terminal Structures:**
- Building clearance: 5m minimum
- Fixed installations: Survey and mark
- Temporary obstructions: Prohibited in clearance zone

### Ground Equipment

**Service Vehicles:**
- Staging area: Beyond wingtip clearance zone
- Active operations: 5m minimum clearance
- High-profile equipment: Special coordination

**Loading Equipment:**
- Cargo loaders: Position verification
- Belt loaders: Clearance monitoring
- Catering trucks: Route planning

## Monitoring Systems

### CAOS Wingtip Proximity System

**Sensors:**
- Wingtip-mounted proximity sensors
- Ground-based reference beacons
- Differential GPS integration
- Inertial measurement units

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time 3D position calculation
- Obstacle detection and ranging
- Predictive collision warnings
- Crew advisory display

**Alert Levels:**
- **Green:** >3m clearance (normal operations)
- **Amber:** 1.5-3m clearance (caution, monitor)
- **Red:** <1.5m clearance (warning, stop if <1m)

### Visual Aids

**Wingtip Position Lights:**
- High-intensity strobes
- Visible 360° horizontally
- Night/low visibility operations
- Battery backup power

**Ground Markings:**
- Wingtip path projection lines
- Clearance zone boundaries
- Critical clearance warnings
- Reflective for night visibility

### Wing Walker Procedures

**Requirement Triggers:**
- Clearance <3m from any obstacle
- Tight taxiway or gate operations
- Low visibility conditions (RVR <400m)
- Training or check flights

**Wing Walker Responsibilities:**
- Continuous wingtip position monitoring
- Clearance estimation and reporting
- Communication with pilots/marshallers
- Stop signal authority

**Equipment:**
- High-visibility vest
- Radio communication
- Illuminated wands (night ops)
- Laser rangefinder (optional)

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Clearance Check

**Flight Crew Actions:**
1. CAOS ground mode activation
2. Wingtip camera visual verification
3. Route clearance review
4. Wing walker coordination (if required)

**Ground Crew Actions:**
1. Visual wingtip clearance verification
2. Route obstacle survey
3. Equipment clearance confirmation
4. Communication check with wing walkers

### Taxi Procedures

**Standard Operations:**
- Speed: 20 kt maximum (straight)
- Turns: 10 kt maximum
- CAOS monitoring: Continuous
- Wing walker updates: Every turn/intersection

**Tight Clearance Operations:**
- Speed: 5 kt maximum
- Wing walkers: Mandatory
- Continuous communication: Required
- Stop-and-check: At critical points

**Emergency Stop:**
- Immediate on red alert (CAOS)
- Immediate on wing walker signal
- Hold position until clearance verified
- Incident reporting required

### Gate Entry/Exit

**Approach:**
- Clearance verification: Before entry
- Speed limit: 5 kt maximum
- Nose gear alignment: Critical
- Wing walker guidance: Standard

**Parking:**
- Stop position: Marked and verified
- Final clearance check: All wingtips
- Chocks and brakes: Set before equipment approach
- GSE clearance: Verified before release

## Weather Considerations

### Crosswind Effects

**Wind Limits:**
- Taxi operations: 35 kt crosswind maximum
- Parking: 50 kt (nose into wind)
- Wing walker operations: 30 kt maximum

**Considerations:**
- Wing flex increases with load
- Roll tendency in gusty conditions
- Reduced visual reference in wind/rain
- Enhanced CAOS monitoring required

### Low Visibility

**Procedures:**
- RVR <550m: Wing walkers mandatory
- RVR <400m: Enhanced lighting required
- RVR <200m: Operations suspended
- Night ops: Additional lighting

## Training Requirements
