- Equipment displacement

### Environmental Hazards

**Noise:**
- Continuous exposure: >85 dB within 25m
- Peak noise: 110 dB at full power (5m)
- Hearing damage risk
- Communication interference

**Vibration:**
- Ground-transmitted vibration
- Equipment interference
- Personnel discomfort
- Structural resonance (nearby objects)

### Electrical Hazards (Specific to Electric Propulsors)

**High Voltage:**
- 800V DC bus system
- Shock hazard if accessed improperly
- Arc flash risk
- Required PPE and procedures

**Electromagnetic Interference:**
- Strong EM fields during operation
- Electronic device interference
- Pacemaker caution
- Compass deviation

## Safety Procedures

### Pre-Start Procedures

**Flight Crew:**
1. Propulsor area clear verification
2. External power disconnected
3. Ground crew clear confirmation
4. Rotating beacon activation

**Ground Crew:**
1. All personnel clear of danger zones
2. Equipment removed from danger zones
3. FOD walk-down completed
4. Ready-to-start signal to crew

### Start Sequence

**Standard Start:**
1. Rotating beacon ON (visual warning)
2. External horn (3-second warning)
3. Propulsor start sequence initiated
4. Monitor for abnormalities

**Personnel Actions:**
- Maintain 25m minimum distance
- Hearing protection required
- Visual monitoring of propulsors
- Communication via radio only

### Operating Procedures

**Propulsors Running:**
- No entry to red zones (0-10m)
- Orange zone access: Authorized only, radio clearance
- Yellow zone: Hearing protection mandatory
- Equipment operations: Coordinate with crew

**Power Changes:**
- Crew announces power increases
- Personnel acknowledge and verify clearance
- Increase airflow awareness
- Secure loose items

### Shutdown Procedures

**Propulsor Shutdown:**
1. Crew announces shutdown
2. Propulsors spool down (60 seconds)
3. Rotating beacon remains ON
4. Crew confirms all-stopped

**Ground Crew Actions:**
- Wait for crew confirmation
- Verify all propulsors stopped
- Visual inspection before approach
- Approach from forward/side (not aft)

## Emergency Procedures

### Propulsor Fire

**Indications:**
- Visual flames or smoke
- Crew fire warning
- Unusual sounds/vibrations
- Burning smell

**Actions:**
1. Crew: Propulsor emergency shutdown
2. Ground: Evacuate 50m radius
3. Fire services: Approach/suppress
4. Personnel: Upwind position
5. Aircraft: Power removal if possible

### Propulsor Failure

**Blade Separation:**
- Immediate 100m evacuation
- Debris field assessment
- No aircraft approach until cleared
- Investigation team notification

**Electrical Failure:**
- Propulsor may not stop normally
- Enhanced caution required
- Electrical isolation procedures
- Maintenance coordination

### Personnel in Danger Zone

**Discovery:**
- Immediate propulsor shutdown (crew)
- Emergency stop signal (ground)
- Assess personnel status
- Medical response if needed

**Prevention:**
- Visual sweep before start
- Camera system monitoring
- Ground crew accountability
- Barrier systems

## Ground Support Equipment

### Equipment Clearances

**GSE Restrictions:**
- Height limit: 3m near propulsors
- Lateral clearance: 10m when operating
- Equipment securing: Mandatory
- Operator training: Required

**Service Vehicles:**
- No approach from aft
- Fuel trucks: 25m minimum (H₂ safety)
- Loaders: Coordinate with crew
- Tugs: Special procedures (towing)

### FOD Control

**Pre-Start:**
