# Exhaust Zones

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-023  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB aircraft utilizes hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric propulsors. Unlike traditional jet engines, these systems produce minimal exhaust—primarily consisting of water vapor and warm air. However, exhaust zone safety considerations still apply.

## Exhaust Characteristics

### Exhaust Composition

**Primary Components:**
- Water vapor (H₂O): 100% of exhaust
- Temperature: 40-60°C at exit
- Pressure: Slightly above ambient
- Velocity: Moderate (proportional to power)

**No Harmful Emissions:**
- No CO₂ emissions
- No NOₓ emissions
- No particulate matter
- No unburned hydrocarbons

### Exhaust Flow Characteristics

**At Idle Power:**
- Velocity: 10-15 m/s
- Temperature: 40°C
- Effective range: 3m aft
- Noise level: 65 dB

**At Taxi Power:**
- Velocity: 30-40 m/s
- Temperature: 50°C
- Effective range: 8m aft
- Noise level: 75 dB

**At Takeoff Power:**
- Velocity: 80-100 m/s
- Temperature: 60°C
- Effective range: 15m aft
- Noise level: 95 dB

## Hazard Categories

### Thermal Hazards (Mild)

**Water Vapor Exposure:**
- Warm, moist air stream
- Minimal burn risk (60°C maximum)
- Condensation on cold surfaces
- Visibility reduction (misting)

**Comparison to Jet Engines:**
- Much lower temperature (jet: 400-600°C)
- Significantly reduced hazard level
- Less restrictive safety zones
- Lower risk category overall

### Mechanical Hazards

**Airflow Effects:**
- High-velocity air stream
- Personnel balance disruption
- Loose items blown aft
- Equipment displacement risk

**Noise Exposure:**
- 95 dB peak at full power
- Hearing protection required <10m
- Communication interference
- Prolonged exposure caution

### Environmental Effects

**Ground Operations:**
- Water condensation on pavement
- Potential slippery surface (cold weather)
- Visibility reduction (misting)
- Ice formation risk (below 0°C)

**Equipment Effects:**
- Moisture exposure
- Electrical equipment considerations
- Corrosion potential (long-term)
- Moisture-sensitive equipment protection

## Safety Zones

### Caution Zone (Orange) - Reduced Hazard

**Dimensions:**
- Aft distance: 8m from exhaust
- Lateral spread: ±4m from centerline
- Height: Ground to 3m
- Status: CAUTION, restricted access when operating

**Marking:**
- Orange barrier cones
- "CAUTION - EXHAUST" signs
- Ground markings (permanent ramps)

**Requirements:**
- Authorized access only
- Radio coordination with crew
- Hearing protection recommended
- Secure loose items

### Awareness Zone (Yellow)

**Dimensions:**
- Aft distance: 8-15m from exhaust
- Lateral spread: ±6m from centerline
- Height: Ground to 3m
- Status: BE AWARE, follow procedures

**Requirements:**
- Awareness of exhaust effects
- Hearing protection at high power
- Equipment secured
- Communication maintained

### Comparison to Traditional Aircraft

**Jet Aircraft Typical Zones:**
- Danger zone (red): 0-50m aft
- Temperature hazard: Severe burns
- Personnel exclusion: Mandatory when operating

**AMPEL360 BWB (H₂ Electric):**
- Caution zone (orange): 0-8m aft
- Temperature hazard: Mild (60°C max)
- Personnel access: Restricted but not prohibited

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Start Procedures

**Flight Crew:**
1. Visual check aft areas (cameras)
2. Confirm ground crew awareness
3. Power-up warnings
4. Start sequence initiation

**Ground Crew:**
1. Clear caution zone of non-essential personnel
2. Secure equipment in exhaust path
3. Communication ready
4. Hearing protection available

### During Operations

**Low Power (Idle/Taxi):**
- Orange zone: Authorized access with coordination
- Equipment: Can operate with caution
- Personnel: Minimize time in zone
- Communication: Maintain with crew

**High Power (Takeoff):**
- Orange zone: Evacuate to yellow zone
- Equipment: Remove or secure
- Personnel: Maintain safe distance
- Brief duration: Typically <30 seconds

### Approach Procedures

**From Aft:**
- Verify propulsor power setting (low)
- Approach outside orange zone
- Coordinate with crew if entry needed
- Quick egress capability

**Preferred Approach:**
- From forward or lateral
- Avoid exhaust path
- Coordinate all movements
- Maintain awareness

## Special Considerations

### Cold Weather Operations

**Ice Formation:**
- Water vapor + cold air = ice
- Pavement icing risk aft of aircraft
- De-icing of ramp may be required
- Enhanced caution on frozen surfaces

**Visibility:**
- Heavy misting in cold conditions
- Reduced visual range
- Enhanced lighting may be required
- Communication reliance increased

### Ground Service Operations

**Aft Service Access:**
- Propulsors at idle or off
- Coordinate with crew before approach
- Time limits in exhaust zone
- Weather considerations (moisture)

**Equipment Positioning:**
- Avoid direct exhaust path
- Moisture-sensitive equipment protected
- Electrical equipment: Enhanced protection
- Maintenance access: Coordinate timing

### Environmental Conditions

**Humidity Effects:**
- High humidity: Increased misting
- Visibility impacts
- Condensation on equipment
- Personnel comfort considerations

**Wind Effects:**
- Crosswind: Exhaust deflection
- Tailwind: Extended exhaust zone
- Headwind: Reduced exhaust zone
- Turbulent conditions: Unpredictable exhaust pattern

## Training Requirements

### All Ground Personnel

**Initial Training:**
- Exhaust zone awareness (H₂ electric specific)
- Safety zone recognition
- Communication procedures
- Weather effect understanding

**Emphasis:**
- Different from jet aircraft
- Reduced but not eliminated hazard
- Moisture and misting effects
- Cold weather considerations

### Specialized Personnel

- Wind direction indicators (if applicable)

## Emergency Procedures

### Abnormal Exhaust

**Indications:**
- Unusual appearance (not just water vapor)
- Unexpected temperature
- Odor present (H₂ system leak?)
- Crew warning/indication

**Actions:**
1. Evacuate exhaust zone
2. Notify crew immediately
3. Assess situation from safe distance
4. Emergency services if needed
5. Do not approach until cleared

### Personnel in Exhaust Zone

**High Power Setting:**
1. Person at risk notification (if possible)
2. Crew reduce power if safe to do so
3. Personnel move to safe area
4. Assess for injury (heat, airflow)
5. Investigate circumstances
