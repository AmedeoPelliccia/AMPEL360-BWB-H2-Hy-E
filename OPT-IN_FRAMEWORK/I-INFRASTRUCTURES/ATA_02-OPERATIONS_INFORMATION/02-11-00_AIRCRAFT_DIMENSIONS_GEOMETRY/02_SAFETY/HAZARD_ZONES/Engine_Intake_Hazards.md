## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Start Procedures

**Flight Crew:**
1. Visual check of intake areas (cameras)
2. Confirm ground crew clear
3. FOD inspection confirmation
4. Start warning activation (beacon, horn)

**Ground Crew:**
1. FOD walk-down of intake areas
2. All personnel clear of red zones
3. Equipment secured or removed
4. Ready-to-start confirmation

### During Operations

**Propulsor Idle:**
- Orange zone access: Authorized with radio clearance
- Maintain awareness of airflow
- No loose items
- Quick egress capability

**Propulsor High Power (Taxi/Takeoff):**
- All personnel in yellow zone or beyond
- Equipment secured
- Visual monitoring
- Communication maintained

### Shutdown Procedures

**Propulsor Spool-Down:**
1. Crew announces shutdown
2. Wait 60 seconds for complete stop
3. Verify airflow cessation
4. Crew confirms safe to approach

**Approach Procedures:**
- Visual verification (intake stopped)
- Approach from side (not forward)
- Listen for residual airflow
- Maintain situation awareness

## FOD Control Procedures

### Pre-Flight FOD Walk-Down

**Intake Areas:**
- 30m forward of each intake
- ±10m lateral coverage
- Remove all debris >10mm
- Document and report findings

**Frequency:**
- Before each flight
- After maintenance in area
- Following high wind events
- Post-snowfall or precipitation

### Daily Operations

**Ramp Cleanliness:**
- Regular sweeping/cleaning
- Drainage maintenance
- Pavement repair promptly
