# Jacking Points Safety

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-040  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB requires specific jacking procedures due to its unique structural configuration. This document defines safety requirements for aircraft jacking operations.

## Jacking Point Configuration

### Primary Jack Points (4 Required)

**Forward Jack Points (2):**
- Location: STA 12m, BL ±8m
- Load capacity: 50,000 kg per point
- Total forward capacity: 100,000 kg
- Structure: Reinforced attachment fittings

**Aft Jack Points (2):**
- Location: STA 28m, BL ±12m
- Load capacity: 50,000 kg per point
- Total aft capacity: 100,000 kg
- Structure: Reinforced attachment fittings

**Total Jacking Capacity:**
- Design: 200,000 kg (>MTOW)
- Safety factor: 2.0 minimum
- MTOW: 185,000 kg

### Jack Point Identification

**Marking:**
- Yellow triangle symbol (75mm)
- "JACK POINT" stenciled
- Load limit marked
- Access panel identification

**Location:**
- Accessible from below aircraft
- Clear of major systems
- Protected from damage

## Jacking Procedures

### Pre-Jacking Requirements

**Aircraft Preparation:**
1. Parking brake set
2. All doors closed
3. Landing gear down and locked
4. Fuel load noted (affects CG and load distribution)
5. Equipment removed from aircraft
6. External power removed

**Equipment:**
- 4× aircraft jacks (50,000 kg capacity minimum each)
- Jack adapters (BWB-specific)
- Load cells (verification, optional but recommended)
- Leveling equipment
- Safety props/stands
- Hydraulic power unit (if hydraulic jacks)

**Personnel:**
- Jack operator (qualified)
- Safety supervisor
- Maintenance technician (documentation)
- Minimum 3 personnel

### Jacking Sequence

**Critical: Aft jacks first, then forward**

1. Position jacks at all four points (do not lift yet)
2. Install jack adapters (proper engagement verified)
3. Verify level aircraft (pitch and roll)
4. Lift aft jacks simultaneously (equal height)
   - Stop at 50mm lift
   - Verify level (roll axis)
   - Continue to desired height
5. Lift forward jacks simultaneously (equal height)
   - Stop at 50mm lift
   - Verify level (pitch axis relative to aft)
   - Continue to desired height
6. Install safety stands (never rely on jacks alone)
7. Verify stability before work commences

**Maximum Jacking Height:** 1.5m (measured at jack points)

### Load Distribution

**Weight Distribution (Approximate):**
- Forward jacks (total): 85,000 kg (46%)
- Aft jacks (total): 100,000 kg (54%)
- Varies with fuel load and CG

**Monitoring:**
- Load cells: Verify load distribution
- No single jack: >27% of aircraft weight
- Level attitude: ±0.5° tolerance

### Lowering Sequence

**Critical: Forward jacks first, then aft**

1. Remove safety stands
2. Lower forward jacks simultaneously (equal rate)
   - Slow, controlled descent
3. Lower aft jacks simultaneously (equal rate)
   - Slow, controlled descent
4. Verify landing gear contact (all three gears)
5. Remove jacks and adapters
6. Final inspection

## Safety Requirements

### Structural Safety

**Jack Point Integrity:**
- Inspect before each jacking operation
- No damage or corrosion permitted
- Load test: Per maintenance schedule
- Repairs: Per SRM only

**Jack Capacity:**
- Minimum 50,000 kg per jack
- Safety factor 2.0 applied
- Certification current
- Hydraulic system: Leak-free

### Operational Safety

**Stability:**
- Level surface required (±0.5° maximum)
- No movement of aircraft during jacked state
- Safety stands mandatory (never rely on jacks alone)
- Jack base: Stable, adequate footprint

**Leveling:**
- Pitch: ±0.5° tolerance
- Roll: ±0.5° tolerance
- Monitoring: Continuous during lifting

**Personnel Safety:**
- No personnel under jacked aircraft (unless safety stands installed)
- Keep clear zone: 5m radius during lifting/lowering
- High-visibility clothing
- Hard hats required

### Environmental Considerations

**Surface:**
- Concrete: Preferred (adequate strength)
- Asphalt: Acceptable if load capacity verified
- Reinforcement pads: Under jack bases as required

**Weather:**
- Wind: Operations suspended if >25 kt
- Rain: Operations suspended (slippery conditions)
- Lightning: Operations suspended (outdoor jacking)

## Equipment Requirements

### Aircraft Jacks

**Specifications:**
- Capacity: 50,000 kg minimum per jack
- Type: Hydraulic (preferred) or mechanical screw
- Certification: Current and documented
- Inspection: Before each use

**Safety Features:**
- Overload protection
- Mechanical locks (hydraulic jacks)
- Stable base (adequate footprint)
- Height indicators

### Jack Adapters

**BWB-Specific:**
- Proper engagement with jack point fittings
- Load distribution across jack point structure
- Anti-slip features
- Inspection: Before each use

### Safety Stands

**Requirements:**
- Capacity: 50,000 kg minimum per stand
- Adjustable height
- Stable base
- Locking mechanism (height adjustment)

**Placement:**
- Adjacent to each jack point
- Load-bearing once installed
- Clearance for jacks (installation/removal)

## Inspection and Documentation

### Pre-Jacking Inspection

**Jack Points:**
- Visual: No damage, corrosion, or deformation
- Structural: Attachment integrity
- Markings: Legible

**Equipment:**
