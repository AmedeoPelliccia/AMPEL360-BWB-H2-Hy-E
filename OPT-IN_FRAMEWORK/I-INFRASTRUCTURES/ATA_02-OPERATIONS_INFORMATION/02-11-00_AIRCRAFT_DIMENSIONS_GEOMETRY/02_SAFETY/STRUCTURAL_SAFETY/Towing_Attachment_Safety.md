# Towing Attachment Safety

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-041  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The AMPEL360 BWB features a dual tow bar attachment system due to its wide center body configuration. This document defines safety procedures for aircraft towing operations.

## Tow Bar Attachment Configuration

### Dual Attachment Points

**Location:**
- Left attachment: STA 12m, BL -5m
- Right attachment: STA 12m, BL +5m
- Attachment spacing: 10m lateral separation

**Design Load:**
- Each attachment: 60,000 kg capacity
- Combined system: 120,000 kg (>MTOW of 185,000 kg)
- Safety factor: 2.0 applied

### Attachment Design

**Structure:**
- Reinforced fittings integrated into nose structure
- Dual load path design (fail-safe)
- Protected from damage during normal operations
- Marked with yellow identification

**Tow Bar Type:**
- Dual tow bar (specialized BWB design)
- Connects to both attachment points simultaneously
- Load distribution: Equal sharing design
- Maximum towing angle: ±30° from centerline

## Towing Procedures

### Pre-Towing Checks

**Aircraft:**
1. Parking brake released
2. Nose steering disconnected (bypassed)
3. Landing gear pins removed (if installed)
4. All doors closed and secured
5. External power removed (if connected)
6. Towing clearance from crew (if onboard)

**Equipment:**
1. Tow vehicle: Adequate capacity (200,000+ kg recommended)
2. Dual tow bar: BWB-specific design, inspected
3. Communication: Radio or intercom established
4. Wing walkers: Assigned (both wingtips)
5. Safety equipment: Chocks, fire extinguisher

### Tow Bar Attachment

**Critical: Both attachments must engage properly**

**Procedure:**
1. Position tow vehicle (centered on aircraft nose)
2. Extend dual tow bar
3. Engage left attachment point
   - Proper fit verified
   - Safety pin installed
4. Engage right attachment point
   - Proper fit verified
   - Safety pin installed
5. Verify load sharing (equal tension both sides)
6. Tow vehicle operator: Final inspection
7. Towing supervisor: Approval to proceed

**Inspection Points:**
- Proper engagement (visual and tactile)
- Safety pins installed and secured
- No binding or misalignment
- Tow bar condition (no damage)

### Towing Operations

**Personnel:**
- Tow vehicle operator
- Towing supervisor (outside vehicle, radio)
- Wing walkers (2, one each wingtip)
- Brake rider (in cockpit, if applicable)

**Speed:**
- Maximum: 5 kt
- Turns: 3 kt maximum
- Congested areas: 2 kt maximum

**Communication:**
- Continuous between all personnel
- Standard signals understood
- Stop signal: Immediate compliance

**Clearances:**
- Wingtip clearance: Monitored by wing walkers
- Forward clearance: Monitored by supervisor
- Nose gear clearance: Adequate for tow bar angle

**Restrictions:**
- Maximum towing angle: ±30° from centerline
- Minimum turning radius: 42m (wingtip to centerline)
- No towing on slopes >3%

### Tow Bar Detachment

1. Aircraft stopped and chocked
2. Parking brake set (if crew onboard)
3. Towing supervisor: Approval to disconnect
4. Remove safety pins (both sides)
5. Disengage right attachment point
6. Disengage left attachment point
7. Retract tow bar
8. Tow vehicle withdrawn
9. Final inspection (tow attachment points)

## Safety Requirements

### Equipment Safety

**Tow Vehicle:**
- Capacity: 200,000+ kg recommended (for 185,000 kg MTOW)
- Brakes: Adequate for aircraft weight
- Parking brake: Functional
- Communication equipment: Installed and functional

**Dual Tow Bar:**
- BWB-specific design (approved)
- Inspection: Before each use
- Condition: No damage, deformation, or excessive wear
- Load sharing: Verified (both sides equal tension)
- Safety pins: Installed and secure during towing

### Structural Safety

**Tow Attachment Points:**
- Inspection: Regular (per maintenance schedule)
- Condition: No damage, corrosion, or deformation
- Load test: Per maintenance schedule
- Repairs: Per SRM only

**Nose Gear:**
- Condition: Serviceable
- Tires: Adequate pressure
- Steering: Disconnected/bypassed during tow
- No abnormal loads (smooth towing only)

### Personnel Safety

**Wing Walkers:**
- Positioned at wingtips
- Continuous monitoring of clearances
- Radio communication with supervisor
- Stop authority

**Towing Supervisor:**
- Overall towing safety responsibility
- Positioned for visibility (forward and wingtips)
- Communication hub (all personnel)
- Stop authority

**Brake Rider (if applicable):**
- In cockpit during towing
- Parking brake available (emergency)
- Communication with towing supervisor
- No normal brake application during tow

**General:**
- Keep clear: 10m from aircraft during towing (except wing walkers, supervisor)
- High-visibility clothing: All personnel
- No personnel between tow vehicle and aircraft

## Environmental Considerations

**Surface:**
- Dry: Normal operations
- Wet: Reduced speed (50%), enhanced caution
- Ice/snow: Operations prohibited (except emergency, <3 kt)
- Slope: Maximum 3%, downslope with caution

**Weather:**
- Wind: >35 kt, operations suspended
- Visibility: >200m required
- Lightning: Operations suspended

**Lighting:**
- Day: Normal
- Night: Enhanced aircraft lighting, tow vehicle lighting
- Low visibility: Enhanced lighting, reduced speed

## Emergency Procedures

### Loss of Control

**Indications:**
- Aircraft not following tow vehicle
- Nose gear sliding
- Abnormal handling

**Actions:**
1. Stop immediately (tow vehicle and aircraft brakes)
2. Assess situation
3. Chock aircraft
4. Investigate cause
5. Corrective action before resuming

### Tow Bar Failure

**Indications:**
- Sudden release
- Abnormal noise
- Visual indication of damage/failure

**Actions:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Chock aircraft
3. Assess damage (personnel safety first)
4. Do not attempt to continue
5. Investigation and corrective action

### Collision Risk

**Actions:**
1. Wing walker stop signal
2. Immediate stop (tow vehicle and aircraft brakes)
3. Assess clearance
4. Proceed only when clearances verified
