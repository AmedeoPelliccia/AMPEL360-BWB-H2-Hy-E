## Overview

This document defines structural limitations and safety requirements for ground support operations on the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## Structural Load Limits

### Fuselage/Center Body Loads

**General:**
- Design limit load factor: 1.5

- No point loads >25 kN without specific approval

**Floor Loading (Cabin/Cargo):**
- Cabin floor: 730 kg/m² (uniform distributed load)
- Cargo floor: 1,220 kg/m² (uniform distributed load)
- Concentrated load: 300 kg over 0.12 m² area

**External Surfaces:**
- Wing upper surface: No standing/walking (except designated areas)
- Wing lower surface: No loading
- Fuselage upper: Designated walkways only (marked)

### Door and Panel Loads

**Passenger Doors:**
- Door sill: 200 kg (distributed, stairs/jetway loading)
- Door structure: No loading (except operational loads)
- Threshold: Protected during service operations

**Cargo Doors:**
- Door sill: 1,000 kg (loader interface)
- Container handling: Per cargo system design
- Door operation: Specified equipment only

**Service Panels:**
- Access panels: No loading (except technician weight)
- Service connections: Per equipment specifications
- Panel support: Not designed for climbing

### Landing Gear Loads

**Static Loading:**
- Maximum static load: 185,000 kg (MTOW)
- Nose gear: 15% of weight
- Main gear: 85% of weight (distributed among struts)

**Jacking:**
- Use designated jack points only
- Load per jack point: 50,000 kg maximum
- Safety stands required (never rely on jacks alone)

**Towing:**
- Tow attachment load: 60,000 kg per point (dual system)
- Towing forces: Smooth application (no jerking)
- Maximum towing angle: ±30° from centerline

## Ground Support Equipment Limitations

### Service Vehicles

**Weight Restrictions:**
- On ramp surface: Per ramp load rating (PCN 80 minimum)
- Under aircraft: Equipment height <2m (belly clearance)
- Near aircraft: Maintain clearances (see Ground Equipment Clearances doc)

**Equipment Types:**
- Cargo loaders: Per cargo system specifications
- Passenger stairs/jetways: Per door specifications
- Catering trucks: Platform load <500 kg total
- Fuel trucks: H₂ refueling procedures (separate doc)
- Ground power units: Electrical connection load limits
- Air conditioning units: Service connection specifications

### Maintenance Platforms

**Access Stands:**
- Stable base required
- Height limit: 8m (wing upper surface access)
- Personnel limit: Per platform design (typically 2-3 persons)
- Load limit: 300 kg typical

**Docking Stands:**
- Wing surface: Designated areas only (marked)
- Fuselage top: Walkways only (marked)
- Door access: Per door specifications

### Lifting Equipment

**Hoists and Cranes:**
- Component removal: Per maintenance manual
- Maximum lift: Varies by component (AMM reference)
- Attachment points: Designated locations only
- Rigging: Certified and inspected

## Service Operation Limits

### Refueling (H₂)

**Weight Limitations:**
- Maximum fuel load: Per loading manual
- CG limitations: Must remain within envelope
- Fueling rate: Per H₂ system specifications
- Simultaneous operations: Restrictions apply (50m safety zone)

### Passenger/Cargo Loading

**Loading Sequence:**
- Per loading manual and weight & balance
- Even loading (minimize lateral imbalance)
- CG envelope: Must remain within limits
- Load securing: Per cargo system design

**Limitations:**
- Maximum cabin load: 220 passengers + bags
- Cargo capacity: Per cargo system design
- Combined passenger/cargo: Per weight & balance

### Servicing Operations

**Water/Waste:**
- Water capacity: System design limit
- Waste capacity: System design limit
- Servicing equipment: Connection load limits

**Oxygen:**
- Ground servicing equipment: Per system specifications
- Connection forces: Gentle (no excessive force)

**Hydraulic:**
- Ground cart: Per system specifications
- Servicing procedures: Per AMM

## Environmental Load Considerations

### Wind Loads

**Parked Aircraft:**
- Maximum wind: 50 kt (nose into wind)
- Crosswind: 40 kt maximum
- Gust loads: Considered in design

**Tie-Down:**
- Required if winds forecast >50 kt
- Tie-down points: Designated locations
- Procedures: Per ground operations manual

### Snow/Ice Loading

**Accumulation:**
- Snow removal: Required if >25mm accumulation
- Ice: Remove before flight (standard de-icing)
- Wing loading: Significant with heavy snow
- Monitoring: Continuous in snow conditions

**De-icing:**
- Fluid application: Per AMS 1424/1428 standards
- Holdover times: Per conditions
- Fluid runoff: Environmental considerations

### Pavement Loading

**Requirements:**
- PCN (Pavement Classification Number): 80/F/B/W/T minimum
- ACN (Aircraft Classification Number): To be published
- LCN (Load Classification Number): To be published

## Inspection and Monitoring

### Daily Inspections

**Ground Operations:**
- Visual: Door areas, service panels, landing gear
- Damage: Report any ground damage immediately
- Fluid leaks: Investigate and repair

### After Ground Incident

**Assessment Required:**
- Any suspected over-load
- Hard contact with ground equipment
- Abnormal forces or impacts
- Towing incidents

**Inspection:**
- Visual: Affected area and adjacent structure
- Detailed: Per maintenance manual (if damage suspected)
- Non-destructive testing: As required
- Airworthiness determination: Before next flight

### Periodic Inspections

**Structural:**
- Landing gear: Per maintenance schedule
- Tow attachments: Per maintenance schedule
- Jack points: Per maintenance schedule
- Door mechanisms: Per maintenance schedule

## Training Requirements

### Ground Service Personnel

**Training:**

- Structural damage recognition
- Proper equipment use
- Incident reporting

### Maintenance Personnel

**Training:**
- Structural load limits (detailed)
