# BWB-Specific Safety Considerations

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-003  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Unique BWB Geometry Hazards

### Wide Center Body (38m)

**Visibility Issues:**
- Pilot blind spots: ±45° from nose, below horizon
- Ground crew visibility compromised
- Cameras/sensors required for full coverage

**Ground Operations:**
- Requires 28m wide gate positions
- Special jetway adapters mandatory
- Multiple service vehicle positions needed
- Tow bar attachment: 2 points (left/right)

### Low Aspect Ratio Wing (AR 3.2)

**Ground Handling:**
- Lower bending stiffness vs conventional
- Fuel load affects wing droop significantly
- Jacking procedures critical (4 points required)

**Wing Flex:**
- Maximum static deflection: +300mm (full fuel)
- Dynamic during taxi: ±150mm
- Monitoring required during refueling

### Large Planform Area (845 m²)

**Wind Sensitivity:**
- Maximum crosswind taxi: 35 kt
- Maximum crosswind parking: 50 kt (nose into wind)
- Weathervaning tendency in strong winds

**Snow/Ice:**
- Large surface area for contamination
- De-icing time: 45 minutes (full aircraft)
- Critical surface inspection requirements

## BWB-Specific Procedures

### Towing

**Attachment Points:**
- Dual tow bars (BL ±5m from centerline)
- Maximum towing angle: ±30° from centerline
- Towing speed: 5 kt maximum

**Precautions:**
- Continuous wing walker monitoring
- CAOS ground clearance monitoring active
- Minimum turning radius: 42m

### Jacking

**Jack Points (4 required):**
- Forward: STA 12m, BL ±8m
- Aft: STA 28m, BL ±12m
- Jacking sequence: Aft first, then forward
- Load per jack: 50,000 kg maximum

### Emergency Egress

**BWB Configuration:**
- 12 exits total (6 Type A, 6 Type III)
- Wide cabin requires distributed exits
- Emergency lighting optimized for 38m width
- Evacuation time: 75 seconds (demonstrated)

**Slide Deployment:**
- Clearance required: 3m radius per slide
- Ground clearance adequate at all exits
- Deployment in crosswind: tested to 35 kt
