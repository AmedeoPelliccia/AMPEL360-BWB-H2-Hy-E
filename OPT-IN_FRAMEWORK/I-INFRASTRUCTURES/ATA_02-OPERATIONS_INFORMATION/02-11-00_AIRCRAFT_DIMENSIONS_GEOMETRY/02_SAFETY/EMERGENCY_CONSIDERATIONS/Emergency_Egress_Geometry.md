# Emergency Egress Geometry

**Document ID:** AMPEL360-02-11-00-SAF-005  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Exit Configuration (BWB-Optimized)

### Exit Locations

**Type A Exits (6×):**
- Forward: STA 8m, BL ±15m, ±18m (4 exits)
- Aft: STA 32m, BL ±12m (2 exits)
- Sill height: 2.5m above ground
- Slide length: 8m

**Type III Exits (6×):**
- Mid-body: STA 18m, BL ±8m, ±12m, ±16m (6 exits)
- Sill height: 2.8m above ground
- Slide length: 7m

### Evacuation Analysis

**Total Capacity:** 220 passengers + 6 crew  
**Demonstrated Time:** 75 seconds (25% margin)  
**Exit Distribution:** Optimized for 38m wide cabin

**Critical Factors:**
- Wide cabin requires multiple lateral exits
- Exit spacing: <18m longitudinal, <12m lateral
- Aisle convergence: 4 aisles to exits
- Emergency lighting: enhanced for width

## Slide Deployment Clearances

### Ground Clearances Required

**Type A Slides:**
- Lateral clearance: 3.5m radius
- Vertical clearance: 0.5m below slide end
- Inflation time: 6 seconds
- Wind limit: 35 kt crosswind

**Type III Slides:**
- Lateral clearance: 3.0m radius
- Inflation time: 5 seconds
- Ground gradient: <5° acceptable

### Obstacle Considerations

**Acceptable:**
- Grass/soft ground
- Shallow water (<0.3m)
- Smooth pavement

**Unacceptable:**
- Rocks/debris >100mm
- Deep water (>0.5m)
- Ditches/culverts
- Other aircraft/equipment

## CFR Access Points

**Primary Access:**
- Forward belly: STA 10m (4.0m × 3.0m opening)
- Aft belly: STA 30m (3.5m × 2.5m opening)
- Cargo doors: 2.5m × 2.0m

**Approach Zones:**
- Forward: Clear 15m × 20m zone
- Aft: Clear 12m × 15m zone
- Lateral: 5m clearance both sides

**Equipment Requirements:**
- Ladder height: 4.5m minimum (cabin floor access)
- Wide-body rescue tools (BWB-specific)
- Multiple simultaneous access points capability
