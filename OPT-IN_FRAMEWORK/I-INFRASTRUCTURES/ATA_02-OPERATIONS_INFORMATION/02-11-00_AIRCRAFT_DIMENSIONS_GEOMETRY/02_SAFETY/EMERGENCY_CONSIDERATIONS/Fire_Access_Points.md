## Secondary Access Points

### Passenger Doors (12 total)

**Type A Doors (6):**

- Aft: STA 32m, BL ±12m (2 doors)
- Sill height: 2.5m above ground
- Access: Main cabin deck, upper deck systems (overhead)

- Sill height: 2.8m above ground
- Access: Main cabin deck (emergency egress, not primary ARFF access)
- Opening: Internal (crew) or external

### Service Panels

**H₂ System Service Panels:**
- Location: STA 22m, BL ±10m (external access)
- Access: H₂ storage tanks, venting, sensors
- Emergency: H₂ system isolation (external controls)
- ARFF training: Required for H₂ system emergency response

**Electrical/Avionics Bays:**
- Location: Multiple, wing and center body
- Access: Specific panels (marked)
- Emergency: Power isolation, fire suppression access

## BWB-Specific Considerations

### Wide Center Body (38m)

**Multiple Access Points:**
- Distributed across width
- Simultaneous ARFF operations possible (multiple crews)
- Coordination: ARFF incident commander

**Access Challenges:**
- Width: Longer approach distances
- Height: Ladder requirements consistent (3-4.5m)
- Visibility: Limited from single vantage point

### Low Profile Design

**Access Height:**
- Generally lower than conventional widebody
- Ladder requirements: Lower (advantage)
- Roof access: Difficult (BWB has no distinct fuselage roof)

## ARFF Approach Zones

### Forward Approach Zone

**Dimensions:** 15m × 20m (forward of nose)

**Clearance Requirements:**
- Clear of fixed obstacles
- Emergency vehicle access
- Personnel staging area
- Lighting (night operations)

**Access Points in Zone:**
- Forward belly access
- Forward cargo door
- Nose landing gear access (if needed)

### Aft Approach Zone

**Dimensions:** 12m × 15m (aft of tail)

**Clearance Requirements:**
- Clear of fixed obstacles
- Emergency vehicle access
- Exhaust consideration (if engines operating - unlikely in emergency)

**Access Points in Zone:**
- Aft belly access
- APU access (if applicable)
- Tail section (structure, vertical stabilizers)

### Lateral Approach Zones (Both Sides)

**Dimensions:** 5m clearance each side, full length

**Clearance Requirements:**
- Wingtip clearance considered
- Service vehicle removal (emergency)
- Multiple door access

**Access Points in Zones:**
- All 12 passenger doors/exits
- Cargo doors (left side)
- Service panels (both sides)
- Wing access (if required)

## ARFF Equipment Requirements

### Ladders

**Requirements:**
- Height: 4.5m minimum (cabin floor access)
- Multiple ladders: 3-4 recommended (simultaneous access)
- Type: Suitable for aircraft rescue (stable, wide base)

### Opening Tools

**Belly Access Panels:**
- Specialized tools: Provided to ARFF by operator
- Training: ARFF personnel trained in use
- Storage: ARFF station (duplicate set maintained)

**Doors:**
- Standard aircraft door opening procedures
- External opening capability (Type A doors)
- Backup: Forcible entry tools (if needed)

### Cutting Equipment

**For Structural Access:**
- Saws (reciprocating, circular)
- Cutters (hydraulic)
- BWB structure: Composite materials (special considerations)
- Procedure: Minimize structural damage, avoid critical systems

## H₂ Safety Considerations

### H₂ System Emergency

**Incident Commander Awareness:**
- H₂ fuel system: Unique hazard
- Leak detection: System installed (crew and ARFF monitoring)
- Ignition risk: High (H₂ is flammable)
- Explosion risk: Moderate (proper venting design)

**ARFF Procedures:**
- Approach: Upwind (H₂ lighter than air, rises)
- Ignition sources: Eliminate (no smoking, no sparks, electrical isolation)
- Water fog: Effective for cooling, dispersion
- Foam: Less effective (H₂ not contained by foam)
- Monitoring: Continuous (H₂ detection equipment)

**Access Restrictions:**
- H₂ tank area: External access only (via service panels)
- Do not breach: H₂ storage tanks
- Isolation: External controls (service panels)

### ARFF Training Requirements

**BWB-Specific:**
- Aircraft familiarization (dimensions, layout)
- Access point locations and procedures
- BWB structural considerations (composites)
- H₂ system emergency response (mandatory)

**Recurrent:**
- Annual refresher
- Airport-specific familiarization
- Live drills (with mockup or actual aircraft)

## Airport Coordination
