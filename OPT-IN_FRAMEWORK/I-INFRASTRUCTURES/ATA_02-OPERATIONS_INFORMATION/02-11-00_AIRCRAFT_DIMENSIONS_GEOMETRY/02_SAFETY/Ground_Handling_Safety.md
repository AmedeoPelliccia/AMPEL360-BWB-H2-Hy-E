## Ground Movement Safety

### Taxi Procedures

**Speed Limits (BWB-specific):**
- Straight taxiway: 20 kt maximum
- Turns: 10 kt maximum
- Congested areas: 5 kt maximum
- Wing walkers required when clearances <2m

**Turning Radius:**
- Minimum: 42m (wingtip to centerline)
- Standard 90° turn requires: 60m × 60m area
- U-turn requires: 95m width minimum

### Marshalling Requirements

**Standard Marshalling:** NOT sufficient for BWB  
**Enhanced Marshalling Required:**
- Lead marshaller (nose)
- 2 wing walkers (wingtips, when clearance <3m)
- Radio communication mandatory
- CAOS ground mode monitoring

**Visual Aids:**
- Wingtip position lights (strobes)
- Ground proximity sensors (CAOS)
- Marshalling cameras (3× external)

## Service Vehicle Operations

### Clearance Zones

**Around Aircraft:**
- Forward (nose): 10m clear zone
- Aft (tail): 8m clear zone
- Lateral (wingtips): 5m clear zone minimum
- Below (belly): 2m vertical clearance for equipment

### Equipment Positioning

**Refueling (H₂):**
- 50m safety zone (personnel exclusion)
- Approach from windward side
- Ground bonding: <3 milliohm resistance
- Fire equipment positioned (2 vehicles)

**Loading:**
- Cargo loaders: 1.0m clearance from doors
- Catering trucks: 0.6m clearance
- Passenger stairs/jetways: 0.5m clearance

## Weather Limitations

**Wind Limitations:**
- Taxi: 35 kt crosswind maximum
- Parking: 50 kt (into wind), 40 kt (crosswind)
- Ground service: 30 kt maximum

**Surface Conditions:**
- Dry: No restrictions
- Wet: Normal ops, reduce taxi speed 50%
- Ice: Ops prohibited (towing only, 3 kt max)
- Snow >50mm depth: Ops prohibited
