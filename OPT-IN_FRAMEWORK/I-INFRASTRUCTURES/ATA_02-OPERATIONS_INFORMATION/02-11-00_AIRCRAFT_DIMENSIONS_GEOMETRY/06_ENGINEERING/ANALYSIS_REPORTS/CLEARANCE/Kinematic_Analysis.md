## 2. Landing Gear Kinematics

### 2.1 Main Landing Gear (MLG)

**Retraction Sequence:**
1. Gear doors open (TBD seconds)
2. Gear retracts upward and aft (TBD seconds)
3. Gear stowed in bay
4. Gear doors close (TBD seconds)

**Total cycle time:** TBD seconds

**Clearances:**
- Gear leg to door: TBD mm (minimum)
- Wheel to wing box structure: TBD mm (minimum)
- Hydraulic lines routing: Adequate clearance verified

### 2.2 Nose Landing Gear (NLG)

**Retraction Sequence:**
1. Gear doors open (TBD seconds)
2. Gear retracts aft and up (TBD seconds)
3. Gear stowed in bay
4. Gear doors close (TBD seconds)

**Total cycle time:** TBD seconds
