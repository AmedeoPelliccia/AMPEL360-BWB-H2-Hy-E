# Loading Analysis

**Analysis ID:** 02-11-00-WB-004  
**Platform:** AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E Q100  
**Analysis Type:** Weight & Balance - Loading Scenarios  
**Status:** Planned  
**Date:** 2025-11-10

---

## 1. Objective

Analyze typical loading scenarios to:
- Verify CG remains within limits for all operational loadings
- Establish loading procedures for ground operations
- Assess ballast requirements (if any)
- Support flight manual development

---

## 2. Loading Scenarios

### 2.1 Passenger Loading Patterns

| Scenario | Pax Count | Distribution | CG X (m) | CG % MAC | In Limits? |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Full (400 pax) | 400 | Uniform | TBD | TBD % | TBD |
| Forward biased | 400 | 70% fwd, 30% aft | TBD | TBD % | TBD |
| Aft biased | 400 | 30% fwd, 70% aft | TBD | TBD % | TBD |
| Half full (200 pax) | 200 | Uniform | TBD | TBD % | TBD |
| Minimum (100 pax) | 100 | Uniform | TBD | TBD % | TBD |

### 2.2 Cargo Loading

| Cargo Bay | Capacity (kg) | CG X (m) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Forward cargo | TBD | TBD | Below cabin, forward |
| Aft cargo | TBD | TBD | Below cabin, aft |
| Bulk cargo | TBD | TBD | Aft of aft cargo bay |

### 2.3 Fuel Loading Sequence

Fuel load sequence to maintain CG within limits during ground refueling:
1. Center body tanks (balanced)
2. Wing tanks (balanced)
3. Trim tank (if required)

## 3. Critical Loading Cases

### 3.1 Forward CG Limit Check
- **Condition:** OEW + full forward cargo + min fuel reserves
- **CG:** TBD % MAC
- **Status:** TBD (must be within forward limit)

### 3.2 Aft CG Limit Check
- **Condition:** OEW + full aft cargo + min fuel reserves
- **CG:** TBD % MAC
- **Status:** TBD (must be within aft limit)

---

## 4. Ballast Requirements

**Analysis:** TBD

If CG cannot be maintained within limits for certain loading conditions, ballast may be required.
