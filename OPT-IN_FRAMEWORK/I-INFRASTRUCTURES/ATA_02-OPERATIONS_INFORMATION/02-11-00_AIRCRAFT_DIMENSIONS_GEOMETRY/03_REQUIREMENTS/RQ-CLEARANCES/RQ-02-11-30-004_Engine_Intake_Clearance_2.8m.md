# RQ-02-11-30-004: Engine Intake Ground Clearance

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The minimum engine intake ground clearance shall be 2.8 meters with landing gear extended in level attitude, preventing foreign object ingestion during ground operations.

## Rationale

**FOD Prevention:**
- Foreign Object Damage (FOD) risk mitigation
- Debris ingestion prevention
- Adequate margin above runway surface
- Water/slush clearance on wet runways

**Engine Protection:**
- Fuel cell air intake protection
- Compressor damage prevention
- Performance degradation avoidance
- Maintenance cost reduction

**BWB Configuration:**
- Top-mounted propulsor installation
- Aft fuselage integration
- Boundary layer ingestion (BLI) considerations
- Improved FOD resistance vs. underwing engines

## Intake Locations

**Propulsor Configuration:**
- Aft fuselage mounted
- Top centerline position
- Boundary layer ingesting inlet
- Ground clearance: 2.8m minimum

**Operating Conditions:**
- Static: 2.8m clearance
- Gear compression (MTOW): 2.6m minimum
- Dynamic (taxi): 2.5m minimum acceptable
- Rotation attitude: >3.0m

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Intake lip lower point location
- Multiple loading conditions
- Gear compression effects
- CAD model verification

**Testing:**
- FOD ingestion risk assessment
- Water ingestion testing (if required)
- Runway surface interaction study
- Operational validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Static clearance ≥ 2.8m ±0.05m
- Compressed gear clearance ≥ 2.6m
- FOD risk acceptable per analysis
- Certification test compliance

## Operational Procedures

**Ground Operations:**
- FOD walk-down before operations
- Runway/taxiway surface inspection
- Debris clearance procedures
- CAOS FOD monitoring (sensor-based)

**Environmental Conditions:**
- Wet runway operations approved
- Snow/slush depth limitations
- Standing water depth limits
- Contaminated runway procedures

## FOD Protection Features

**Design Features:**
- Intake lip shape optimized
- Boundary layer diverter (if applicable)
- FOD screening (if required)
- Intake door system (if applicable)

**Monitoring:**
- Pre-flight inspection procedures
- Post-flight inspection requirements
- Borescope inspection intervals
- Engine condition monitoring
