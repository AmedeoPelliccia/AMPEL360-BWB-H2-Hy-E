# RQ-02-11-30-006: Pavement Requirements

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft shall be compatible with pavements having a minimum Pavement Classification Number (PCN) of 80 or equivalent bearing strength, enabling operations at major airports worldwide.

## Rationale

**Airport Compatibility:**
- PCN 80 widely available at major airports
- Enables global route network
- Standard for wide-body aircraft
- Infrastructure accessibility

**Load Distribution:**
- MTOW: 185,000 kg
- Main gear configuration: Multi-wheel bogies
- Load per wheel: Optimized for PCN 80
- Tire pressure: Standard for category

**BWB Considerations:**
- Wide main gear track: Better load distribution
- Lower tire loads vs. concentrated loads
- Improved pavement compatibility
- Enhanced operational flexibility

## Pavement Classification

**PCN 80 / R / B / W / T:**
- **80**: Bearing strength (PCN value)
- **R**: Rigid pavement (concrete)
- **B**: Medium strength subgrade
- **W**: Maximum tire pressure (limited to standard)
- **T**: Technical evaluation method

**Equivalent ACN:**
- Aircraft Classification Number: ACN ≤ 78
- Flexible pavement: ACN ≤ 75
- Rigid pavement: ACN ≤ 78
- Overload procedures: ACN +5 max

## Landing Gear Design

**Configuration:**
- Main gear: Twin tandem bogies (8 wheels total)
- Nose gear: Twin wheels
- Wheel base: 15.5m
- Main gear track: 12.0m

**Load Distribution:**
- Main gear: 95% of aircraft weight
- Nose gear: 5% of aircraft weight
- Load per main wheel: ~22,000 kg
- Tire pressure: 14 bar (200 psi)

## Verification Method

**Analysis:**
- ACN/PCN calculation per ICAO method
- Pavement stress analysis
- Tire contact pressure verification
- Overload scenario assessment

**Testing:**
- Static load testing (if required)
- Rolling load validation
- Pavement interaction study
- Airport compatibility survey

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ACN ≤ PCN for target airports
- Pavement stress within limits
- Compatible with 95% of target airports
- Operational procedures validated

## Operational Considerations

**Pavement Types:**
- Concrete (rigid): Preferred
- Asphalt (flexible): Acceptable with ACN margin
- Composite: Case-by-case evaluation
- Grass/unpaved: Not authorized

**Special Operations:**
- Overweight landing: PCN +10 required
- Repeated operations: Fatigue consideration
- Turning/braking loads: Stress concentration
- Taxiway pavement: Same requirements

## Airport Survey

**Target Airports:**
- 98% of ICAO Code E airports: PCN ≥80
- Major hubs: PCN 85-100 typical
- Regional airports: Case-by-case
- New construction: PCN 90+ standard

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- [ICAO Annex 14](https://www.icao.int/safety/pages/annex-14.aspx) (Aerodrome Design)
- [ICAO Doc 9157](https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9157) (ACN-PCN method)
- [FAA AC 150/5320-6](https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/) (Aircraft classification)
