# RQ-02-11-30-002: Belly Ground Clearance

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The minimum belly ground clearance shall be 1.8 meters at Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) with landing gear extended in level attitude, measured at the lowest point of the center body underside.

## Rationale

**Operational Safety:**
- Prevents fuselage strike during rotation
- Adequate clearance for uneven surfaces
- Ground equipment access underneath
- Debris strike protection

**Rotation Requirements:**
- Takeoff rotation angle: 12° maximum
- Tail clearance at rotation: >0.3m
- Adequate pitch authority
- No tail or belly scrape risk

**Ground Operations:**
- Towing and jacking clearance
- Maintenance access underneath
- Service vehicle passage
- Emergency egress space

## Critical Points

**Lowest Points:**
- Center body aft section: Critical area
- Aft pressure bulkhead vicinity: 1.8m minimum
- Equipment bays: 2.0m typical
- Forward section: 2.2m typical

## Verification Method

**Static Measurement:**
- MTOW loading condition
- Level attitude on flat surface
- Multiple measurement points
- Laser scanning verification

**Dynamic Testing:**
- Rotation tests on runway
- Takeoff performance validation
- Pitch attitude monitoring
- Clearance margin verification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Static clearance ≥ 1.8m ±0.05m
- Dynamic clearance at 12° rotation ≥ 0.3m
- No contact during test program

## Operational Procedures

**Normal Operations:**
- Standard rotation rate
- Pitch limit: 12° ground operations
- Automatic monitoring (CAOS)
- Crew awareness training

**Abnormal Conditions:**
- Overweight landing procedures
- Rough field operations restrictions
- Enhanced inspection after hard landing
- Tail strike inspection criteria
