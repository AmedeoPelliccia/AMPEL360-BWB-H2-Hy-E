# RQ-02-11-50-005: Pavement Strength Requirements

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft shall operate on pavements with a minimum Pavement Classification Number (PCN) of 80, ensuring compatibility with Code E airport infrastructure worldwide through optimized landing gear design and load distribution.

## Rationale

**Global Operations:**
- PCN 80 standard for Code E airports
- Enables access to major international hubs
- Wide network coverage
- Infrastructure compatibility

**Load Characteristics:**
- MTOW: 185,000 kg
- Main gear: Distributed multi-wheel design
- Optimized tire pressure: 14 bar (200 psi)
- Lower unit loading than conventional designs

**BWB Advantages:**
- Wide main gear track: 12.0m
- Better load distribution
- Multiple wheel bogies
- Reduced pavement stress

## ACN/PCN Method

**Aircraft Classification Number (ACN):**
- Rigid pavement: ACN = 78
- Flexible pavement: ACN = 75
- Subgrade strength: Medium (B)
- Tire pressure: Standard (W)

**Pavement Classification Number (PCN):**
- Minimum requirement: PCN 80
- Typical Code E airports: PCN 80-100
- Major hubs: PCN 90+ common
- New construction: PCN 85+ standard

**Compatibility:**
- ACN ≤ PCN for all operations
- Adequate margin for all airports
- Overload procedures: Limited to PCN +5
- Pavement protection assured

## Landing Gear Configuration

**Main Gear:**
- Configuration: Twin tandem bogies
- Total wheels: 8 (4 per side)
- Wheel spacing optimized for load distribution
- Load per wheel: ~22,000 kg at MTOW

**Design Features:**
- Wide track: Better lateral stability + load spreading
- Multiple wheels: Reduced point loads
- Optimized geometry: Pavement stress minimization
- Advanced materials: Weight optimization

## Verification Method

**Analysis:**
- ACN calculation per ICAO Doc 9157
- Pavement stress analysis (FEM)
- Multiple pavement types evaluated
- Subgrade strength variations

**Validation:**
- Static load testing (if required)
- Strain gauge measurements
- Pavement deflection studies
- Long-term fatigue assessment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ACN ≤ 78 on rigid pavement
- ACN ≤ 75 on flexible pavement
- Compatible with PCN 80+ airports
- Pavement life impact acceptable

## Operational Considerations

**Normal Operations:**
- Full weight operations: PCN 80+ required
- Overweight conditions: PCN 85+ required
- Repeated operations: Fatigue consideration
- Turning/braking: Localized stress analysis

**Pavement Types:**
- Concrete (rigid): Primary target
- Asphalt (flexible): Acceptable
- Composite pavements: Case-by-case
- Unpaved: Not authorized

## Airport Survey Results

**PCN Distribution:**
- PCN ≥80: 98% of Code E airports
- PCN 80-89: 45% of Code E airports
- PCN 90-99: 40% of Code E airports
- PCN 100+: 13% of Code E airports

**Geographic Coverage:**
- North America: Excellent (99%)
- Europe: Excellent (99%)
- Asia: Excellent (98%)
- Rest of World: Good (95%)

## Special Operations

**Limited Pavement:**
- PCN 70-79: Engineering analysis required
- Reduced weight operations possible
- Limited cycles permitted
- Airport approval mandatory

**Monitoring:**
- Pavement condition reporting
- Damage inspection procedures
- Maintenance coordination
- Load monitoring system (CAOS)

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ICAO Annex 14 (Pavement design)
- ICAO Doc 9157 (ACN-PCN Method)
- FAA AC 150/5320-6 (Aircraft classification)
- EASA CS-25 (Landing gear design)

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-30-006 (Pavement Requirements)
- RQ-02-11-50-001 (Taxiway Width)
- RQ-02-11-50-004 (Runway Width)
- Landing gear design requirements
