# RQ-02-11-50-003: Gate Compatibility

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft shall be compatible with ICAO Code E gates having minimum stand dimensions of 80m x 80m, enabling operations at major international airports with standard wide-body gate infrastructure.

## Rationale

**Airport Access:**
- Maximizes available gates worldwide
- Standard wide-body gate compatibility
- Passenger boarding bridge access
- Ground service equipment positioning

**BWB Unique Requirements:**
- Wide center body: 38m width
- Standard wingspan: 52m
- Gate width clearance: 42m minimum required
- Specialized jetway adapter may be needed

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Single gate operations
- Standard turnaround procedures
- Multiple door access
- Ground equipment compatibility

## Gate Dimensional Requirements

**Minimum Stand Dimensions:**
- Length: 80m (nose to tail clearance)
- Width: 80m (wingtip to wingtip clearance)
- Obstacle-free zone: 65m x 65m minimum
- Wingtip clearance to adjacent stands: 7.5m

**Aircraft Positioning:**
- Parking guidance system required
- Centerline alignment critical
- Multiple stop positions (aircraft type variations)
- CAOS-assisted parking available

## Passenger Boarding Bridges

**Standard Configuration:**
- 1-3 jetways typical for wide-body gates
- Jetway adapter required for BWB configuration
- Multiple door access capability
- Emergency exit accessibility

**BWB-Specific Requirements:**
- Wide body door distribution
- Door threshold heights
- Jetway reach requirements
- Floor height variations along body

## Ground Service Access

**Equipment Positioning:**
- Cargo loading: Forward and aft positions
- Catering: Multiple access points
- Fuel service: Refueling panel locations
- H₂ refueling: Specialized equipment required
- GPU/ASU: Standard connections
- Lavatory service: Multiple service points
- Water service: Standard connections

**Clearance Requirements:**
- Ground equipment envelope
- Simultaneous service operations
- Safety zones maintained
- Emergency access preserved

## Verification Method

**Analysis:**
- Gate dimensional survey
- Aircraft envelope vs. gate clearances
- Service vehicle positioning study
- Jetway reach analysis

**Operational Validation:**
- Airport compatibility assessment
- Gate trials at representative airports
- Service procedure validation
- Turnaround time studies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Compatible with 90% of Code E gates
- Standard turnaround achievable (45-60 min)
- All service access confirmed
- Safety clearances maintained

## Airport Compatibility Survey

**Target Airports:**
- Major international hubs: 100% compatible
- Regional Code E airports: 95% compatible
- New construction: BWB-optimized gates
- Retrofit requirements: Minimal

**Gate Modifications:**
- Jetway adapters: Required at most gates
- Pavement markings: Updated for BWB
- Service procedures: Training required
- Charging/H₂ infrastructure: New installation

## Special Considerations

**Unique BWB Features:**
- No distinct fuselage
- Wide cabin doors distributed across body
- Multiple jetway positions possible
- Enhanced marshalling required

**Operational Procedures:**
- Gate approach procedures
- Parking alignment
- Jetway positioning sequence
- Service vehicle choreography

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ICAO Annex 14 (Gate design - Code E)
- IATA AHM (Airport Handling Manual)
- SAE AIR1845 (Boarding bridge interface)

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-20-001 (Center Body Width)
- RQ-02-11-10-001 (Wingspan)
- RQ-02-11-50-001 (Taxiway Width)
- RQ-02-11-50-006 (Parking Stand)
