# RQ-02-11-50-006: Parking Stand Dimensions

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft shall fit within standard ICAO Code E parking stand dimensions of 80m x 80m minimum, enabling efficient apron operations and compatibility with existing airport infrastructure.

## Rationale

**Apron Operations:**
- Standard stand size at Code E airports
- Gate and remote stand compatibility
- Ground service operations space
- Multiple aircraft parking density

**Space Requirements:**
- Aircraft envelope: 52m x 38.2m (W x L)
- Safety clearance: 7.5m minimum to adjacent aircraft/objects
- Service vehicle access lanes
- Emergency vehicle access

**BWB Considerations:**
- Wide center body requires lateral clearance
- Standard wingspan fits Code E stand
- Service access on all sides
- Multiple door access points

## Parking Stand Layout

**Minimum Dimensions:**
- Stand length: 80m
  - Aircraft length: 38.2m
  - Nose clearance: 15m
  - Tail clearance: 15m
  - Margin: 11.8m

- Stand width: 80m
  - Aircraft wingspan: 52m
  - Wingtip clearance each side: 7.5m minimum
  - Service vehicle lanes: 6m each side
  - Total: 52 + 15 + 13 = 80m

**Safety Zones:**
- Wingtip clearance: 7.5m to obstacles
- Nose/tail clearance: 10m to obstacles
- Emergency access: All sides
- Fire fighting access: Maintained

## Ground Service Operations

**Equipment Positioning:**
- Ground power unit (GPU): Forward right
- Air conditioning unit (ACU): Forward right
- Cargo loaders: Forward/aft left and right
- Catering trucks: Multiple positions
- Fuel service: Aft right (or H₂ service position)
- Lavatory/water service: Aft positions
- Passenger stairs/jetways: Multiple doors
- Baggage tractors: Forward/aft

**Service Vehicle Clearances:**
- Vehicle lane width: 6m minimum
- Turning radius for equipment
- Simultaneous service operations
- Safety zone maintenance

## Verification Method

**Analysis:**
- Stand dimension survey
- Aircraft envelope modeling
- Service vehicle simulation
- Clearance validation

**Operational Validation:**
- Ground handling trials
- Service procedure validation
- Turnaround time studies
- Safety assessment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Fits within 80m x 80m stand
- All safety clearances maintained
- Service access confirmed
- Turnaround efficiency acceptable

## Parking Procedures

**Standard Parking:**
- Pilot-controlled to stop position
- Marshaller guidance
- Visual docking guidance system (VDGS)
- CAOS parking assist available

**Safety Procedures:**
- Wheel chocks placement
- Safety cones deployment
- Ground power connection
- Communication established

## Stand Marking Requirements

**Pavement Markings:**
- Aircraft centerline
- Nose wheel stop position
- Wingtip clearance lines
- Service vehicle lanes
- Safety zones
- Fire access routes

**BWB-Specific Markings:**
- Wide body outline
- Multiple door positions
- Service point locations
- H₂ refueling zone (if applicable)

## Remote Stand vs. Gate

**Remote Stand:**
- 80m x 80m minimum
- Passenger stairs access
- Bus loading positions
- All-weather operations

**Gate Stand:**
- 80m x 80m minimum + jetway zones
- Jetway adapter zones
- Terminal building clearance
- Passenger flow management

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ICAO Annex 14 (Apron design - Code E)
- IATA AHM 904 (Stand design)
- FAA AC 150/5300-13A

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-50-003 (Gate Compatibility)
- RQ-02-11-10-001 (Wingspan)
- RQ-02-11-10-002 (Overall Length)
- RQ-02-11-50-005 (Pavement Strength)
