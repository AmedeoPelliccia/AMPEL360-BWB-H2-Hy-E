# RQ-02-11-20-004: Leading Edge Sweep 37°

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The wing leading edge sweep angle shall be 37 degrees ±0.5 degrees, measured at the 25% chord line relative to the lateral axis.

## Rationale

**High-Speed Performance:**
- Delays shock wave formation
- Increases critical Mach number (Mcr ≈ 0.85)
- Enables efficient cruise at M0.82
- Reduces wave drag at transonic speeds

**BWB Integration:**
- Smooth transition from center body
- Continuous leading edge contour
- Balanced aerodynamic loading
- Structural load distribution

**Stability and Control:**
- Contributes to longitudinal stability
- Affects center of pressure location
- Influences control surface effectiveness
- Supports natural pitch stability

## Measurement Definition

**Reference Line:**
- 25% chord line (quarter-chord line)
- Measured from lateral axis (Y-axis)
- Sweep angle constant from centerline to 80% span
- Variable sweep in wingtip region (45-50°)

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- CAD model measurement
- Lofted surface analysis
- Multiple chord stations verified
- Photogrammetry validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 36.5° ≤ LE Sweep ≤ 37.5° (at 25% chord)
- Continuous sweep distribution
- No discontinuities in leading edge
- Documented in design freeze

## Aerodynamic Considerations

**Transonic Effects:**
- Delayed shock formation
- Reduced wave drag
- Improved L/D at cruise
- Enhanced buffet margin

**Low-Speed Performance:**
- Higher stall speed than unswept wing
- Leading edge devices required
- Enhanced high-lift system
- Adequate low-speed handling
