# RQ-02-11-20-005: Planform Continuity

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The BWB planform shall maintain continuous curvature (Class A surface continuity) across all transitions between center body and outer wing sections with no discontinuities in surface slope or curvature.

## Rationale

**Aerodynamic Performance:**
- Eliminates flow separation points
- Maintains laminar flow regions
- Minimizes pressure discontinuities
- Optimizes lift distribution

**BWB Design Philosophy:**
- No distinct fuselage-wing junction
- Smooth aerodynamic blending
- Continuous lifting surface
- Integrated structural design

**Manufacturing Quality:**
- Class A surface requirements
- Automated manufacturing compatibility
- Composite layup requirements
- Surface quality standards

## Surface Continuity Requirements

**G2 Continuity (Curvature Continuous):**
- Position (G0): Continuous
- Tangency (G1): Continuous slope
- Curvature (G2): Continuous curvature
- No visible breaks or kinks

**Critical Blend Regions:**
- Center body to inner wing transition
- Inner wing to outer wing transition
- Wing to winglet transition (if applicable)
- All control surface fairings

## Verification Method

**CAD Analysis:**
- Curvature comb analysis
- Zebra stripe visualization
- Gaussian curvature mapping
- Surface quality report

**Physical Verification:**
- Laser scanning of molds/tools
- Production article scanning
- Surface finish measurements
- Visual inspection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- G2 continuity verified across all transitions
- No slope discontinuities >0.1°
- No curvature discontinuities >0.01 m⁻¹
- Class A surface quality achieved

## Impact on Performance

**Aerodynamic Benefits:**
- 2-3% drag reduction vs. discontinuous design
- Enhanced laminar flow (15-25% chord)
- Reduced interference drag
- Improved L/D ratio

**Manufacturing Considerations:**
- Complex mold design required
- Precision tooling necessary
- Surface quality inspection critical
- Assembly tolerance control

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ATA iSpec 2200 (Surface quality)
- Aerospace surface quality standards
- Composite manufacturing standards
- Class A surface requirements
