# RQ-02-11-20-002: Center Body Length

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The BWB center body length shall be 28.5 meters ±0.1 meter, measured from the forward pressure bulkhead (STA 5.0m) to the aft pressure bulkhead (STA 33.5m).

## Rationale

**Cabin Requirements:**
- Passenger seating area: 220 seats
- Galley and lavatory space
- Emergency exit distribution
- Cabin attendant stations

**H₂ System Integration:**
- Forward H₂ tank: STA 15-22m
- Aft H₂ tank: STA 25-32m
- Tank support structure
- Safety separation zones

**Structural Optimization:**
- Pressure vessel length optimization
- Load distribution efficiency
- Weight and balance envelope
- Center of gravity range

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Laser measurement along centerline
- Station markers at bulkheads
- Internal pressure boundary verification
- CAD model validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 28.4m ≤ Length ≤ 28.6m
- Bulkhead locations verified
- Station system alignment confirmed

## BWB Configuration

**Design Features:**
- Integrated lifting body
- Gradual transition to wing sections
- Continuous aerodynamic surface
- No distinct wing-body junction

**Volume Distribution:**
- Forward: Cockpit and front cabin
- Center: Main cabin and H₂ tanks
- Aft: Rear cabin and systems

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- CS-25.365 (Pressurization)
- CS-25.841 (Cabin Design)
- ATA iSpec 2200

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-20-001 (Center Body Width)
- RQ-02-11-40-002 (Station System)
- RQ-02-11-10-002 (Overall Length)
