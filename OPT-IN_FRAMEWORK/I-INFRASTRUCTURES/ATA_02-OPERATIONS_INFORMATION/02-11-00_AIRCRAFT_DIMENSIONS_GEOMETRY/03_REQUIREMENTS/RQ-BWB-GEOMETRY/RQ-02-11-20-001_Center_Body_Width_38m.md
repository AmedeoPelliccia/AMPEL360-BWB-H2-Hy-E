# RQ-02-11-20-001: Center Body Width

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The BWB center body maximum width shall be 38.0 meters ±0.1 meter, measured at Station 15.0m at the widest point of the pressurized cabin section.

## Rationale

**Cabin Layout:**
- Accommodates 220 passengers in single-class configuration
- Provides 8-abreast seating in center section
- Supports wide cabin concept (38m width)
- Optimizes passenger comfort and efficiency

**Structural Efficiency:**
- Distributed loads across wide center body
- Efficient pressure vessel geometry
- Integration with wing structure
- Lower bending moments than conventional fuselage

**H₂ Tank Integration:**
- Upper deck volume for cryogenic tanks
- Separation from passenger cabin
- Thermal management advantages
- Safety segregation compliance

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Optical measurement system (photogrammetry)
- Multiple cross-sections measured
- At STA 15.0m (maximum width location)
- Both external and internal dimensions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 37.9m ≤ Width ≤ 38.1m
- Symmetry: ±100mm left-right
- Contour continuity verified

## BWB-Specific Considerations

**Design Features:**
- Blended transition to wing sections
- No distinct fuselage-wing boundary
- Continuous lifting surface
- Pressurization boundary definition

**Operational Impact:**
- Gate width requirement: 42m minimum
- Jetway adapter necessary
- Wide-body handling procedures
- Enhanced marshalling required
