# RQ-02-11-20-006: Cross Section Geometry

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The BWB cross-sectional geometry shall transition smoothly from the pressurized center body (elliptical/circular sections) to the outer wing airfoil sections, maintaining structural efficiency and aerodynamic performance throughout.

## Rationale

**Structural Requirements:**
- Center body: Pressure vessel (circular/elliptical)
- Transition region: Gradual shape morphing
- Outer wing: Airfoil sections for lift generation
- Load path continuity maintained

**Aerodynamic Optimization:**
- Minimize interference drag
- Maintain continuous pressure distribution
- Support laminar flow where possible
- Integrate high-lift devices

**Pressurization Boundary:**
- Pressure vessel in center body
- Non-pressurized outer wing sections
- Pressure bulkhead integration
- Structural pressure loads

## Cross Section Definitions

**Center Body (STA 5-33):**
- Shape: Near-circular to elliptical
- Height/Width ratio: 0.25-0.35
- Pressurization: 8.5 psi (0.59 bar)
- Passenger cabin volume

**Transition Region (STA 33-40, BL ±10-19):**
- Gradual morphing from body to airfoil
- Smooth cross-section evolution
- Structural continuity maintained
- Non-pressurized volume

**Outer Wing (BL >19m):**
- Airfoil sections (supercritical type)
- Thickness ratio: 14-8% (root to tip)
- Optimized for transonic cruise
- Integral fuel tanks (if applicable)

## Verification Method

**CAD Analysis:**
- Cross-section extraction at defined stations
- Shape analysis and verification
- Structural FEM model validation
- Manufacturing feasibility review

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All cross sections within design envelope
- Smooth transitions verified (G2 continuity)
- Structural load paths confirmed
- Pressure vessel integrity validated

## Design Considerations

**Pressure Loads:**
- Center body sized for 8.5 psi differential
- Pressure bulkhead at transition
- Emergency depressurization capability
- Fatigue life requirements

**Manufacturing:**
- Composite construction throughout
- Complex tool design for transitions
- Assembly joint locations optimized
- Inspection access provided

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- CS-25.365 (Pressurization loads)
- CS-25.841 (Pressurized cabins)
- CS-25.571 (Damage tolerance)

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-20-001 (Center Body Width)
- RQ-02-11-20-005 (Planform Continuity)
- RQ-02-11-20-007 (Wing Thickness Distribution)
