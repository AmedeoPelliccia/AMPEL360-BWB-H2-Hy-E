# RQ-02-11-10-004: Wing Area Specification

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft wing reference area shall be 845 square meters ±5 square meters, measured as the total projected area including the center body lifting surface.

## Rationale

**Aerodynamic Performance:**
- Wing loading: 219 kg/m² at MTOW
- Provides adequate lift at cruise
- Supports L/D ratio of 21
- Enables efficient BWB operations

**BWB Design:**
- Entire center body generates lift
- No distinct wing-fuselage boundary
- Continuous lifting surface
- Reference area includes center body

**Performance Requirements:**
- Takeoff distance: 2,400m at MTOW
- Landing distance: 1,800m at MLW
- Cruise efficiency optimization
- Low-speed handling characteristics

## Verification Method

**Calculation:**
- CAD model area computation
- Projected area on XY plane
- Includes center body lifting surface
- Accuracy: ±0.5m²

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 840m² ≤ Wing Area ≤ 850m²
- CAD model verification
- Design freeze documentation

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- CS-25.25 (Weight Limits)
- CS-25.103 (Stall Speed)
- Aerodynamic Design Standards

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-10-001 (Wingspan)
- RQ-02-11-20-003 (Aspect Ratio)
- RQ-02-11-20-005 (Planform Continuity)

## Traceability

**Derived From:**
- Performance requirements
- Weight and balance analysis
- Aerodynamic optimization

**Impacts:**
- Performance calculations
- Weight and balance
- Structural design loads
