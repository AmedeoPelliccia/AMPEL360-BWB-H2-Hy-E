# RQ-02-11-10-003: Overall Height Specification

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft overall height shall be 14.5 meters ±0.05 meter, measured from ground level to the highest structural point with landing gear extended in level attitude.

## Rationale

**Hangar Clearance:**
- Standard hangar height: 16-18m
- Adequate clearance for maintenance
- Equipment access requirements

**Ground Operations:**
- Tail clearance on rotation
- Service vehicle access
- Loading equipment compatibility

**ICAO Code E:**
- Height limit: Not specified for Code E
- Standard hangar compatibility maintained
- Ground service equipment compatible

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Laser measurement from ground to highest point
- Accuracy: ±5mm
- Level surface, landing gear extended
- Empty weight condition

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 14.45m ≤ Height ≤ 14.55m
- Measured at highest structural point
- Documented in As-Built

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- [ICAO Annex 14](https://www.icao.int/safety/pages/annex-14.aspx)
- [CS-25.25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27)
- Airport Design Standards

**Related Requirements:**
- [RQ-02-11-30-003](../RQ-CLEARANCES/RQ-02-11-30-003_Tail_Clearance_2.5m_Min.md) (Tail Clearance)
- [RQ-02-11-50-003](../RQ-AIRPORT-COMPATIBILITY/RQ-02-11-50-003_Gate_Compatibility.md) (Gate Compatibility)
- RQ-02-11-16-001 (Ground Clearance)

## Traceability

**Derived From:**
- Hangar compatibility requirements
- Ground service requirements
- Aerodynamic design

**Impacts:**
- Hangar selection
- Ground service equipment
- Maintenance procedures
