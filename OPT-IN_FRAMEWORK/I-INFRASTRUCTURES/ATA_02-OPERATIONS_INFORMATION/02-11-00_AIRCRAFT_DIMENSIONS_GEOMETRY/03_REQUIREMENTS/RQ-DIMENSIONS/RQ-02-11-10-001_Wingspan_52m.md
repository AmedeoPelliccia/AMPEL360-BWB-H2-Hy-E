# RQ-02-11-10-001: Wingspan Specification

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft wingspan shall be 52.0 meters ±0.1 meter, measured from wingtip to wingtip at the outermost structural point.

## Rationale

**ICAO Code E Compliance:**
- Wingspan 52m < 65m (Code E upper limit)
- Enables operations at Code E airports worldwide
- Balances aerodynamic efficiency with infrastructure constraints

**Aerodynamic Optimization:**
- Provides aspect ratio 3.2 (optimal for BWB)
- Supports lift-to-drag ratio L/D = 21
- Enables 30% fuel efficiency improvement

**Operational Considerations:**
- Taxiway width requirement: 23m minimum
- Gate compatibility: Wide-body capable
- Turning radius: 42m achievable

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Laser scanning measurement ±5mm accuracy
- Three-point measurement verification
- Conducted at ambient temperature (15°C ±5°C)
- Landing gear extended, level attitude

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 51.9m ≤ Wingspan ≤ 52.1m
- Left-right symmetry: ±50mm
- Documented in As-Built configuration

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ICAO Annex 14 (Aerodrome Design)
- CS-25.25 (Weight Limits)
- ATA iSpec 2200 (Documentation)

**Related Requirements:**
- RQ-02-11-10-005 (ICAO Code E)
- RQ-02-11-50-001 (Taxiway Width)
- RQ-02-11-20-003 (Aspect Ratio)

## Traceability

**Derived From:**
- Market Requirements (Range + Efficiency)
- Airport Infrastructure Survey
- Aerodynamic Design Analysis

**Impacts:**
- Airport compatibility procedures
- Ground handling equipment design
- Wing structural design
- Control surface sizing
