# RQ-02-11-10-002: Overall Length Specification

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft overall length shall be 38.2 meters ±0.1 meter, measured from the nose apex to the aft-most structural point along the centerline.

## Rationale

**Operational Requirements:**
- Gate compatibility at major airports
- Parking stand dimensions
- Hangar accommodation requirements

**BWB Configuration:**
- Optimized fuselage length for BWB design
- Passenger capacity: 220 passengers
- Cargo volume optimization
- H₂ tank integration space

**Infrastructure Compatibility:**
- Standard wide-body gate compatibility
- Turning radius requirements
- Taxiway and runway operations

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Laser scanning from nose to tail
- Accuracy: ±10mm
- Level attitude, landing gear extended
- Temperature: 15°C ±5°C

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 38.1m ≤ Length ≤ 38.3m
- Centerline alignment verified
- As-Built documentation

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- ICAO Annex 14
- CS-25.25
- ATA iSpec 2200
