# RQ-02-11-10-002: Overall Length Specification

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Requirement Statement

The aircraft overall length shall be 38.2 meters ±0.1 meter, measured from the nose apex to the aft-most structural point along the centerline.

## Rationale

**Operational Requirements:**
- Gate compatibility at major airports
- Parking stand dimensions
- Hangar accommodation requirements

**BWB Configuration:**
- Optimized fuselage length for BWB design
- Passenger capacity: 220 passengers
- Cargo volume optimization
- H₂ tank integration space

**Infrastructure Compatibility:**
- Standard wide-body gate compatibility
- Turning radius requirements
- Taxiway and runway operations

## Verification Method

**Measurement:**
- Laser scanning from nose to tail
- Accuracy: ±10mm
- Level attitude, landing gear extended
- Temperature: 15°C ±5°C

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 38.1m ≤ Length ≤ 38.3m
- Centerline alignment verified
- As-Built documentation

## Compliance

**Standards:**
- [ICAO Annex 14](https://www.icao.int/safety/pages/annex-14.aspx)
- [CS-25.25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27)
- [ATA iSpec 2200](https://www.ataebooks.org/product-category/ispec-2200/)

- [RQ-02-11-50-002](../RQ-AIRPORT-COMPATIBILITY/RQ-02-11-50-002_Turning_Radius_42m.md) (Turning Radius)
- [RQ-02-11-40-002](../RQ-REFERENCE-SYSTEMS/RQ-02-11-40-002_Station_System_Definition.md) (Station System)

## Traceability

**Derived From:**
- Passenger capacity requirements
- Cargo volume requirements
- H₂ system integration

**Impacts:**
- Airport gate selection
- Ground handling procedures
- Maintenance hangar requirements
