# Dimensional Documentation Plan

**Component Code:** 02-11-00  
**Folder:** 09_PRODUCTION_PLANNING/SERIAL_NUMBER_MANAGEMENT  
**Document:** Dimensional_Documentation_Plan.md

## Purpose

This document defines what dimensional documentation is generated for each Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN), where it is archived, and how it interfaces with certification, operations, and maintenance documentation for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## Overview

Comprehensive dimensional documentation is essential for:
- **Certification:** Demonstrating conformance to type design and regulations
- **Operations:** Providing accurate dimensions for flight planning and ground handling
- **Maintenance:** Supporting inspections, repairs, and modifications
- **Configuration management:** Tracking dimensional changes throughout aircraft life
- **Customer support:** Delivering complete dimensional data package with aircraft

This plan ensures consistent, complete, and traceable dimensional documentation for each MSN.

**Review Timing:** Before as-built configuration freeze, before aircraft delivery

**Non-Conformance:** Any documentation deficiency generates documentation NCR, corrected before proceeding

## Continuous Improvement

### Documentation Process Metrics

**Metric 1: Documentation Cycle Time**
- Time from as-built measurements complete to as-built configuration freeze
- Target: ≤1 week for serial production
- Track trends, identify bottlenecks

**Metric 2: Documentation Error Rate**
- Number of documentation errors discovered post-delivery
- Target: ≤0.1 errors per aircraft
- Root cause analysis for errors, process improvements

**Metric 3: Customer Satisfaction**
- Customer feedback on dimensional data package quality and completeness
- Target: ≥4.5/5.0 satisfaction rating
- Incorporate feedback into documentation improvements

### Lessons Learned

**Source:** Prototype (MSN-P001) and pre-production (MSN-PP001 to MSN-PP010) phases

**Process Improvements:**
- Automate data extraction from measurements to as_built_geometry_MSN-XXX.json (reduce manual entry errors)
- Standardize document templates for consistency across MSNs
- Integrate CAOS digital twin earlier in process (real-time data capture)
- Improve measurement-to-documentation traceability (clear linkage in database)

**Documentation Improvements:**
- Add visual aids (3D models, deviation color maps) to deviation analysis report
- Enhance customer delivery package with interactive content (e.g., 3D PDF with embedded geometry)
- Provide structured data (JSON, CSV) in addition to PDF for customer integration
