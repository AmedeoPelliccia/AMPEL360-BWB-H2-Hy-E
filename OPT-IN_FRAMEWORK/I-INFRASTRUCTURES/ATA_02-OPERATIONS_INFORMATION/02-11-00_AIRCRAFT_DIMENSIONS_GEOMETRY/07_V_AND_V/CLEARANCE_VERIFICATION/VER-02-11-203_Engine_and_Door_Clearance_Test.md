# VER-02-11-203: Engine and Door Clearance Test

**Verification ID:** VER-02-11-203  
**Component:** 02-11-00 Aircraft Dimensions Geometry  
**Test:** Engine Intake and Door Sill Clearance Verification  
**Status:** Template Ready - Awaiting Test Execution

## 1. Objective

Verify clearances for:
- Engine intake ground clearance (2.8 m minimum)
- Passenger door sill height (4.3 m for boarding compatibility)
- Cargo door ground clearance (2.2 m for loading equipment)
- H₂ refueling connection access (2.5 m)

## 3. Test Methods

### 3.1 Engine Intake Clearance
- Measure lowest point of engine intake to ground
- Test at level attitude on landing gear
- Verify adequate FOD (Foreign Object Damage) protection

### 3.2 Door Sill Height
- Measure door sill height from ground
- Verify compatibility with standard airport boarding bridges
- Test door operation and clearance envelope

### 3.3 Cargo Door Clearance
- Measure cargo door threshold to ground
- Verify compatibility with standard cargo loaders
- Check clearance for loading equipment maneuvering

### 3.4 H₂ Connection Access
- Verify refueling connection point accessibility
- Check clearance for ground service equipment
- Validate safe working envelope for personnel

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

All measured clearances must meet or exceed minimum required values.
