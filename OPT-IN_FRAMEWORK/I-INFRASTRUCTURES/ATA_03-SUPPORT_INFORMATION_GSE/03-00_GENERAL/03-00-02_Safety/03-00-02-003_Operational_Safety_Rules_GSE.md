## 2. General Safety Rules

### 2.1 Stop Work Authority

**All GSE personnel have the authority and responsibility to stop work immediately if they observe unsafe conditions or practices.**

- No disciplinary action shall be taken for exercising stop work authority in good faith
- Operations may only resume after hazards are addressed and approval is given by a supervisor

### 2.2 Pre-Operation Requirements

Before operating any GSE, operators must:

1. **Check Serviceability**: Verify equipment is serviceable (no defects, maintenance current)
2. **Conduct Walk-Around**: Visual inspection for damage, leaks, tire condition, safety devices
3. **Test Safety Systems**: Verify brakes, lights, alarms, emergency stops are functional
4. **Review Task**: Understand the task, hazards, and control measures
5. **Verify PPE**: Ensure all required PPE is worn and in good condition

### 2.3 Fitness for Duty

GSE operators must be:

- **Qualified and Current**: Hold valid GSE operator qualification for the equipment type
- **Physically and Mentally Fit**: Not impaired by fatigue, illness, medication, or substances
- **Authorized**: Have written authorization or work permit if required

## 6. Marshalling and Communication

### 6.1 Marshalling Signals

All GSE operations near aircraft require use of standard [ICAO marshalling signals](https://www.skybrary.aero/articles/ground-signals):

- **Approach**: Beckoning with one or both arms
- **Stop**: Arms crossed overhead
- **Emergency Stop**: Rapid waving of arms
- **Slow Down**: Patting motion with hands

### 6.2 Communication Protocols

- **Radio Communications**: Use designated GSE frequency, standard phraseology
- **Visual Contact**: Maintain visual contact with marshaller/wing walkers at all times
- **Hand Signals**: Acknowledge hand signals with clear visual confirmation
- **Emergency Communications**: Use emergency frequency 121.5 MHz if required

### 6.3 Pre-Task Briefing

Before complex GSE operations (e.g., aircraft pushback, H₂ refuelling), conduct a **safety briefing**:
- Task description and sequence
- Roles and responsibilities
- Hazards and control measures
- Communication methods
- Emergency procedures and signals

## 7. Equipment Operation Standards

### 7.1 GSE Connection to Aircraft

- **Power Before Connect**: Ensure GSE is powered down before connecting to aircraft
- **Ground First**: Connect ground cable before any power or service connections
- **Visual Inspection**: Inspect connections for damage, contamination, proper engagement
- **Chocks in Place**: Aircraft chocks must be in place before connecting any GSE
- **Disconnect Sequence**: Reverse of connection sequence (power cables last, ground cable first)

### 7.2 Towing Operations

- **Qualified Operator**: Only qualified tow tractor operators may tow aircraft
- **Weight Limits**: Do not exceed tow tractor rated capacity
- **Wing Walkers**: Minimum 2 wing walkers for all aircraft towing
- **Speed Limit**: Maximum 5 km/h during towing
- **Clearance Check**: Verify clearance from obstacles, other aircraft, buildings
- **Tow Bar Inspection**: Inspect tow bar for damage, cracks, proper pin engagement

### 7.3 Refuelling Operations

### 8.2 Visibility Limitations

- **Minimum Visibility**: 500m for aircraft towing and critical GSE operations
- **Poor Visibility**: Use additional lighting, reduce speed, increase vigilance
- **Fog / Heavy Rain**: Consider suspending non-essential GSE movements

### 8.3 Lightning / Thunderstorms

- **Lightning within 10 km**: Cease all refuelling operations (H₂ and Jet-A)
- **Lightning within 5 km**: Cease all GSE operations near aircraft
- **All-Clear**: Operations may resume 30 minutes after last lightning strike observed within 10 km

### 8.4 Ice and Snow

## 9. Emergency Procedures

### 9.1 Emergency Stop

If an emergency occurs (fire, collision, H₂ leak, injury):
1. **Stop**: Immediately stop all GSE operations
2. **Secure**: Secure equipment (park brake, chocks, shutdown)
3. **Alert**: Notify emergency services (fire/rescue, medical, security)
4. **Evacuate**: Evacuate personnel from danger area if required
5. **Report**: Report incident to supervisor and GSE Safety Manager

### 9.2 Fire

- **Activate Alarm**: Activate nearest fire alarm
- **Fight if Safe**: Use fire extinguisher only if fire is small and contained
- **Evacuate**: If fire is spreading, evacuate immediately
- **Call Fire Brigade**: Emergency number (local equivalent of 112/911)

### 9.3 H₂ Leak

See [03-00-02-004_H2_Specific_Safety_Considerations.md](./03-00-02-004_H2_Specific_Safety_Considerations.md) for detailed H₂ emergency procedures.

**Immediate Actions**:
