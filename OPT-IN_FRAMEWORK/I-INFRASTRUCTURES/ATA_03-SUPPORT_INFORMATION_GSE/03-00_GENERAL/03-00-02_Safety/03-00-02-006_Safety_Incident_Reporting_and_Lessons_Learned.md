# 03-00-02-006 — Safety Incident Reporting and Lessons Learned for GSE

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **incident and near-miss reporting workflow, classification, investigation, and lessons-learned loop** for Ground Support Equipment (GSE) operations under [ATA 03 – Support Information GSE](https://www.ata.org/resources/specifications/ispec2200).

It establishes:

- Incident and near-miss definitions and classification
- Reporting procedures and timelines
- Investigation methodologies
- Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) processes
- Lessons learned dissemination and knowledge management

---

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Incident

An **incident** is an unplanned event that results in:
- **Injury** to personnel (requiring medical treatment)
- **Damage** to equipment, aircraft, or property (requiring repair or replacement)
- **Operational Disruption** (flight delay, cancellation, or diversion)

### 2.2 Near-Miss

A **near-miss** (also called "near-hit" or "close call") is an unplanned event that **could have** resulted in injury, damage, or disruption but did not, either by chance or timely intervention.

**Examples:**
- GSE operator narrowly avoids collision with aircraft
- H₂ leak detected before ignition or significant accumulation
- Equipment failure detected during pre-operation check (before use)

### 2.3 Hazard Report

A **hazard report** is a proactive report of an unsafe condition or practice that has the potential to cause an incident if not addressed.

**Examples:**
- Damaged pavement creating trip hazard
- Inadequate lighting in GSE parking area
- Unclear markings on refuelling zone boundaries

## 3. Incident Classification

### 3.1 Severity Classification

Incidents are classified by severity to prioritize investigation and response:

| Severity | Description | Examples | Investigation Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Fatality or multiple serious injuries; catastrophic equipment/aircraft damage | Fatality, H₂ explosion, aircraft collision | Full investigation by senior team |
| **Serious** | Serious injury (hospitalization); major equipment/aircraft damage; significant operational disruption | Lost time injury, aircraft damage, flight cancellation | Detailed investigation by GSE Safety Manager |
| **Moderate** | Minor injury (first aid); moderate equipment damage; minor operational disruption | Recordable injury, GSE collision (no aircraft damage), short delay | Investigation by supervisor |
| **Low** | No injury or very minor; minor equipment damage; no operational impact | Property damage only, equipment malfunction (no injury) | Basic investigation by supervisor |

### 3.2 Incident Type Classification

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Collision** | GSE collision with aircraft, personnel, other GSE, or fixed objects |
| **Fire/Explosion** | Fire or explosion involving GSE, H₂, or other fuels |
| **Injury** | Personnel injury (slip/trip/fall, struck by, caught between, etc.) |
| **Equipment Failure** | GSE mechanical or system failure |
| **H₂ Safety Event** | H₂ leak, cryogenic release, or H₂-related safety event |
| **Operational Error** | Procedural violation, incorrect operation, communication error |
| **Environmental** | Weather-related incident, contamination, spill |

## 4. Reporting Procedures

### 4.1 Immediate Reporting (within 15 minutes)

**All personnel** who witness or are involved in an incident or near-miss must:

1. **Ensure Safety**: Secure the area, provide first aid if required, prevent further harm
2. **Notify Supervisor**: Immediately notify GSE supervisor or Ground Operations Manager
3. **Preserve Evidence**: Do not move equipment or disturb scene unless required for safety

**Supervisor Actions:**
- Assess situation and determine severity
- Notify GSE Safety Manager (for Serious or Critical incidents)
- Notify emergency services if required (fire/rescue, medical, security)
- Secure incident scene and preserve evidence

### 4.2 Formal Incident Report (within 24 hours)

**All incidents and near-misses** must be documented in a formal incident report within 24 hours.

**Report Submission:**
- Electronic incident reporting system (preferred)
- Paper incident report form (if electronic system unavailable)
- Submit to: GSE supervisor and GSE Safety Manager

**Required Information:**
- Date, time, and location of incident
- Personnel involved (names, roles, injuries)
- Equipment involved (equipment ID, type, condition)
- Description of incident (what happened, sequence of events)
- Immediate causes (what went wrong)
- Witnesses (names and contact information)
- Photos and evidence (attach to report)
- Initial corrective actions taken

### 4.3 Regulatory Reporting

**Critical and Serious incidents** may require reporting to regulatory authorities:

- **EASA** (for safety occurrences under [EU Regulation 376/2014](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0376))
- **National Aviation Authority** (as required by local regulations)

## 5. Investigation Procedures

### 5.1 Investigation Objectives

The purpose of incident investigation is to:
- Determine **root causes** (not just immediate causes)
- Identify **system failures** and **contributing factors**
- Develop **corrective and preventive actions** to prevent recurrence
- Learn and improve safety management system

**Investigation is NOT:**
- To assign blame or punishment
- To determine liability (handled separately by legal/HR)
- To rush to conclusions without evidence

### 5.2 Investigation Team

| Incident Severity | Investigation Team |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Senior management, GSE Safety Manager, H₂ Safety Specialist (if H₂-related), external expert (if required) |
| **Serious** | GSE Safety Manager, Ground Operations Manager, relevant subject matter experts |
| **Moderate** | GSE supervisor, GSE Safety Manager (review) |
| **Low** | GSE supervisor (basic investigation) |

### 5.3 Investigation Timeline

| Incident Severity | Investigation Timeline | Report Completion |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Commence immediately | Within 30 days |
| **Serious** | Commence within 24 hours | Within 14 days |
| **Moderate** | Commence within 48 hours | Within 7 days |
| **Low** | Commence within 5 days | Within 7 days |

### 5.4 Investigation Methodology

#### Step 1: Evidence Collection
- Interview witnesses (separately to avoid contamination)
- Photograph incident scene and equipment
- Collect physical evidence (damaged parts, PPE, documents)
- Review GSE maintenance records, operator qualifications, training records
- Review CCTV footage (if available)
- Obtain weather data, operational logs, communication recordings

#### Step 2: Timeline Reconstruction
- Develop detailed timeline of events leading to incident
- Identify sequence of actions, decisions, and conditions
- Map human actions, equipment states, and environmental factors

#### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis
Use structured analysis methods:

**5 Whys Analysis** (for simple incidents)
- Ask "Why?" repeatedly (typically 5 times) to drill down to root cause
- **Example:**
  - Incident: GSE operator collided with aircraft
  - Why? Operator did not see wing tip
  - Why? Operator was focused on marshaller
  - Why? Operator relied on marshaller instead of direct observation
  - Why? Operator was not trained on importance of direct visual scanning
  - **Root Cause:** Training gap in situational awareness

**Fishbone Diagram / Ishikawa Diagram** (for complex incidents)
- Categorize causes: People, Procedures, Equipment, Environment, Management
- Identify contributing factors in each category
- Determine root causes and system failures

**MORT (Management Oversight and Risk Tree)** (for critical incidents)
- Systematic analysis of management systems, barriers, and controls
- Identify failures in safety management oversight

#### Step 4: Contributing Factors
Identify all contributing factors:
- **Human Factors**: Fatigue, distraction, complacency, skill-based error
- **Equipment Factors**: Design flaws, maintenance issues, equipment failure
- **Procedural Factors**: Inadequate procedures, lack of procedures, non-compliance
- **Organizational Factors**: Inadequate training, poor supervision, time pressure
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather, lighting, noise, workspace layout

#### Step 5: Barriers and Controls Analysis
- Identify **barriers that failed** (what should have prevented the incident?)
- Assess **barrier effectiveness** (were barriers adequate? properly implemented?)
- Determine **system weaknesses** that allowed incident to occur

### 5.5 Investigation Report

The investigation report shall include:
1. **Executive Summary** (key findings and recommendations)
2. **Incident Description** (what happened, timeline, personnel/equipment involved)
3. **Evidence** (witness statements, photos, records)
4. **Analysis** (root cause analysis, contributing factors, barrier failures)
5. **Findings** (immediate causes, underlying causes, root causes)
6. **Recommendations** (corrective actions, preventive actions, safety improvements)
7. **Appendices** (detailed evidence, diagrams, reference documents)

---

## 6. Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)

### 6.1 CAPA Development

For each root cause and contributing factor, develop:

**Corrective Actions** (address immediate causes, prevent recurrence of this specific incident)
- **Example:** Repair damaged GSE equipment, retrain operator who violated procedure

**Preventive Actions** (address underlying system issues, prevent similar incidents)
- **Example:** Revise training program to address identified skill gap, implement additional safety controls

### 6.2 CAPA Prioritization

CAPAs are prioritized based on:
- **Risk Reduction**: Potential impact on preventing future incidents
- **Feasibility**: Cost, resources, and time required to implement
- **Regulatory Requirement**: Whether action is mandated by regulation or standard

### 6.3 CAPA Implementation

- **Owner Assignment**: Each CAPA assigned to a responsible individual
- **Target Date**: Realistic completion date established
- **Resource Allocation**: Budget, personnel, equipment allocated as required
- **Tracking**: CAPA status tracked in safety management system
- **Verification**: Completion verified by GSE Safety Manager

### 6.4 CAPA Effectiveness Review

After CAPA implementation, effectiveness shall be assessed:
- **Short-Term** (1 month): Verify CAPA is implemented as intended
- **Medium-Term** (3-6 months): Monitor incident trends related to CAPA
- **Long-Term** (annual): Evaluate sustained effectiveness and identify any further improvements

## 8. Just Culture and Non-Punitive Reporting

### 8.1 Just Culture Principles

AMPEL360 promotes a **Just Culture** that:
- Encourages **open and honest reporting** of incidents, near-misses, and hazards
- Distinguishes between **honest mistakes** (no blame) and **reckless behavior** (accountability)
- Focuses on **system improvement** rather than individual blame
- Protects reporters from **punitive action** for good-faith reporting

### 8.2 No-Blame Reporting

Personnel who report incidents, near-misses, or hazards in good faith will **not** face:
- Disciplinary action
- Negative performance reviews
- Retaliation or discrimination

**Exception:** Willful violations of safety rules, reckless behavior, or criminal conduct are subject to disciplinary action.

### 8.3 Confidential Reporting

Personnel may submit **confidential or anonymous reports** if they are uncomfortable with identifying themselves:
- Anonymous reporting available through electronic system or hotline
- Confidential reports reviewed by GSE Safety Manager only
- Reporter identity not disclosed without consent
