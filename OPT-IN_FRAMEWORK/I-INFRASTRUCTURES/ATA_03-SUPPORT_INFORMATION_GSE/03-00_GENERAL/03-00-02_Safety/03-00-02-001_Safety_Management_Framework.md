- **Safety Culture**: Fostering a proactive safety culture where all personnel are empowered to report hazards and stop unsafe operations

### 2.2 Safety Objectives

1. **Prevent Accidents and Incidents**: Eliminate GSE-related accidents through proactive hazard management
2. **Minimize H₂ Safety Risks**: Ensure safe handling of hydrogen fuel and related equipment
3. **Maintain Compliance**: Achieve and maintain compliance with [EASA Part 21](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/regulations/commission-regulation-eu-no-7482012), [CS-25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-amendment-27), [IATA AHM](https://www.iata.org/en/publications/manuals/airport-handling-manual/), and [ICAO Annex 14](https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/Annexes/Pages/annex-14.aspx)
4. **Promote Safety Awareness**: Ensure all GSE personnel are trained and competent in safety procedures
5. **Learn from Events**: Investigate incidents thoroughly and implement corrective actions

## 4. Safety Processes

### 4.1 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

See [03-00-02-002_Hazard_Identification_and_Risk_Assessment.md](./03-00-02-002_Hazard_Identification_and_Risk_Assessment.md) for detailed methodology.

**Process:**
1. Continuous hazard identification through operations, audits, and incident reports
2. Risk assessment using risk matrices and bow-tie analysis
3. Risk control measures (elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, PPE)
4. Risk register maintenance and periodic review

### 4.2 Operational Safety Rules

See [03-00-02-003_Operational_Safety_Rules_GSE.md](./03-00-02-003_Operational_Safety_Rules_GSE.md) for detailed rules.

**Core Rules:**
- Speed limits (10 km/h near aircraft, 5 km/h in congested areas)
- Exclusion zones around aircraft and H₂ refuelling operations
- Mandatory PPE (high-visibility vests, safety footwear, hearing protection, H₂ safety equipment)
- Traffic management and right-of-way rules
- Marshalling and communication protocols

### 4.3 Training and Competency

See [03-00-02-005_Safety_Training_and_Competency.md](./03-00-02-005_Safety_Training_and_Competency.md) for detailed requirements.

**Training Framework:**
- Initial training and qualification
- Recurrent training (annual)
- Competency assessments
- H₂-specific safety training for relevant personnel
- Emergency response training

### 4.4 Incident Reporting and Investigation

See [03-00-02-006_Safety_Incident_Reporting_and_Lessons_Learned.md](./03-00-02-006_Safety_Incident_Reporting_and_Lessons_Learned.md) for detailed workflow.

**Process:**
1. Immediate reporting of incidents and near-misses
2. Incident classification and severity assessment
3. Investigation by qualified personnel
4. Root cause analysis
5. Corrective and preventive action implementation
6. Lessons learned dissemination

### 4.5 Safety Audits and Inspections

See [03-00-02-008_Safety_Audits_and_Inspections.md](./03-00-02-008_Safety_Audits_and_Inspections.md) for detailed procedures.

**Audit Schedule:**
