# 03-70 - PROPULSION

**ATA Chapter:** 03 - Support Information GSE  
**Origin Block:** 70 - Propulsion / Energy (mapped to 70/80 family as needed)  
**Status:** Active

---

## Purpose

This directory contains propulsion and energy systems for Ground Support Equipment, including electric drives, hydraulic systems, and power distribution for mobile GSE.

---

## Structure

Concrete systems under this origin block are structured according to their design and implementation needs, not following the mandatory 14-folder lifecycle pattern.

Each subsystem `03-70-YY_*` has its own internal design-driven structure.

---

## Example Systems

Placeholder for future GSE propulsion and energy systems:
