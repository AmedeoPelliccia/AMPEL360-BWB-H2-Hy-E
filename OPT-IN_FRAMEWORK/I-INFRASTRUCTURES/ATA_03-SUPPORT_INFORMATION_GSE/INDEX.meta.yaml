  ATA Chapter 03 contains all documentation related to Ground Support Equipment
  for the AMPEL360 aircraft, including specifications, manuals, and certification.
  Structure follows the Law of Origin numbering system (20=Systems, 50=Structures,
  80=Energy, 90=Schemas/Meta).

numbering_system:
  law_of_origin: true
  rules:
    "20-xx": "Systems - Functional handling, maintenance, and operational systems"
    "50-xx": "Structures - Physical frames, platforms, and support structures"
    "80-xx": "Energy - Propulsion support, refueling, and power equipment"
    "90-xx": "Schemas/Meta - Documentation, catalogues, training, registries"
  reference: "../../NUMBERING_RULES.md"

scope:
  - GSE functional systems and programs
  - GSE structural support equipment
  - GSE energy and refueling equipment
  - GSE documentation and catalogues
  - Interface specifications
  - Safety procedures and protocols
  - Training and certification

migration_notes: |
  Version 2.0.0 implements the Law of Origin numbering system:
  - Old 03-10-xx codes migrated to 03-20-xx (systems)
  - Old 03-40-xx codes migrated to 03-90-xx (catalogues/meta)
  - New structure aligns with AMPEL360 framework-wide numbering rules
  - All subsystems now use 14-folder lifecycle skeleton
