# 03-00-00 - GENERAL

**ATA Chapter:** 03  
**System Name:** Support Information GSE  
**Status:** Active

---

## Overview

This directory contains the general framework, standards, and governance for ATA 03 - Support Information GSE within the AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E program.

The structure follows the mandatory 14-folder lifecycle pattern defined by the AMPEL360 Documentation Standard v1.4, based on the canonical ATA 95-00-00_GENERAL reference.

---

## Purpose

This general layer provides:
- Framework and standards for all ATA 03 subsystems
- Common requirements and interfaces
- Safety objectives and governance
- Certification approach
- Integration guidelines
