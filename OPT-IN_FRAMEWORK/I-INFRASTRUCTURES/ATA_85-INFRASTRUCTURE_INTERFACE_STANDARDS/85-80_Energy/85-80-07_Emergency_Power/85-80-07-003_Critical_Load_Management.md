# 85-80-07-003 Critical Load Management

## Document Information

- **Document ID**: 85-80-07-003
- **Title**: Critical Load Management Standards
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: DRAFT
- **Date**: 2025-11-22

## Purpose

Standards for managing critical loads during emergency conditions.

## Load Priority Classification

### Priority 1 - Life Safety (Never Shed)

- Fire detection and suppression
- Emergency lighting and exit signs
- Air traffic control systems
- Critical communication systems
- H2 safety systems

### Priority 2 - Essential Operations

- Reduced HVAC for critical areas
- Security systems
- Partial apron lighting
- Fuel handling systems

### Priority 3 - Non-Essential

- General lighting (non-critical areas)
- Retail and administrative loads
- Passenger comfort systems

## Load Shedding Strategy

### Automatic Load Shedding

- Triggered by generator overload or utility loss
- Sequential shedding: Priority 3 → 2 (partial) → 1 (never)
- Time delays between stages: 5-10 seconds

### Manual Load Shedding

- Emergency operations center override
- Situation-based decision making
- Restoration priority sequence

## Testing and Drills

- Quarterly load shedding tests
- Annual full emergency scenario drill
- Documentation of performance and lessons learned
