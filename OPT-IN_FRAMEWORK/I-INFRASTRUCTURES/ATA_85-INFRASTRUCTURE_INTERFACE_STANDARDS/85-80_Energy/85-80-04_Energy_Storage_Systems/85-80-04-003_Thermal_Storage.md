# 85-80-04-003 Thermal Storage

## Document Information

- **Document ID**: 85-80-04-003
- **Title**: Thermal Energy Storage Standards
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: DRAFT
- **Date**: 2025-11-22

## Purpose

Standards for thermal energy storage systems for HVAC load shifting.

## System Types

### Chilled Water Storage

- **Technology**: Stratified tanks, ice storage
- **Capacity**: 1,000-10,000 ton-hours
- **Application**: Pre-cooling during off-peak, discharge during peak

### Hot Water Storage

- **Technology**: Insulated tanks, phase-change materials
- **Capacity**: Based on heating load profile
- **Application**: Pre-heating, process heat buffering

## Design Criteria

- Storage sizing based on load profile analysis
- Thermal losses: <5% per 24-hour cycle
- Integration with HVAC control system

## Standards

- [ASHRAE 90.1](https://www.ashrae.org/) - Energy Standard for Buildings
- Local building energy codes
