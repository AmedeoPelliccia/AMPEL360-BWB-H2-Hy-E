# Coordination Study Summary
# - Discrimination time between stages: 0.3s minimum
# - Backup protection time-graded with primary
# - Auto-reclose: Single-shot on 33kV feeders disabled on 11kV
# - SEF settings provide sensitive earth fault detection
# - Anti-islanding for DER per IEEE 1547
# - Arc flash incident energy calculated per IEEE 1584 (see separate study)

# Notes:
# - Settings are preliminary and subject to detailed coordination study
# - CT/VT ratios to be confirmed based on actual equipment
# - Relay models are examples (SEL) - actual make/model per procurement
# - Testing required after commissioning and any system modifications
# - Annual verification of protection settings recommended
