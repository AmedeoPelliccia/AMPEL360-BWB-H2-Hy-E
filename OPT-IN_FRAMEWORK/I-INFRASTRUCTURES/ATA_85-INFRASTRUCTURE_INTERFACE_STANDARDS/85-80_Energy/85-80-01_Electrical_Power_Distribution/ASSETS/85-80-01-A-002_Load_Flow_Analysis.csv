# Analysis Notes:
# - Load flow based on peak operational scenario
# - Voltage regulation within acceptable limits (±5%)
# - All feeders below 80% loading for contingency margin
# - PV generation reduces grid import by ~24%
# - BESS provides peak shaving and power quality support
# - Detailed analysis required for fault levels harmonic distortion and transient stability
