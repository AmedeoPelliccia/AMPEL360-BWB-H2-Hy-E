## 1. Purpose

This document provides guidance on adapting infrastructure structures for cold climate conditions, including:

- Material selection for low-temperature service
- Freeze-thaw protection measures
- Snow and ice load provisions
- Foundation frost protection

---

## 2. Temperature Ranges

**Design Temperatures**:
- Winter design temperature: -40°C to -20°C (site-specific)
- Summer design temperature: +20°C to +30°C
- Daily temperature swing: Up to 30°C

---

## 3. Material Adaptations

### 3.1 Concrete

- **Air entrainment**: 5-7% for freeze-thaw resistance per [ACI 318](https://www.concrete.org/)
- **Low water-cement ratio**: <0.45 to reduce permeability
- **Supplementary cementitious materials**: Fly ash or slag for durability
- **Curing**: Extended curing period (minimum 7 days) with protection

### 3.2 Structural Steel

- **Impact testing**: Charpy V-notch testing at -40°C (minimum 27 J)
- **Grade selection**: ASTM A992 with enhanced toughness or ASTM A913 Grade 65
- **Welding procedures**: Preheat requirements per [AWS D1.1](https://www.aws.org/)

### 3.3 Protective Coatings

- **Low-temperature flexibility**: Coatings must remain flexible at -40°C
- **UV resistance**: Enhanced UV protection for snow reflection
- **Application temperature**: Follow manufacturer's cold-weather application procedures

---

## 4. Foundation Design

### 4.1 Frost Protection

- **Frost depth**: Design per local frost depth maps (typically 1.5-2.5 m)
- **Insulation**: Rigid foam insulation beneath slabs and around perimeter
- **Drainage**: Prevent water accumulation near foundations
- **Heated foundations**: Consider for H₂ facilities to prevent frost heave

### 4.2 Permafrost Considerations

(Where applicable)

- **Thermosyphons**: Active or passive ground cooling
- **Pile foundations**: Minimize heat transfer to permafrost
- **Monitoring**: Ground temperature monitoring system

---

## 5. Snow and Ice Loads

### 5.1 Roof Design

- **Snow load**: Per [ASCE 7](https://www.asce.org/) Ch. 7 or local codes (typically 2.5-5.0 kPa)
- **Drift loads**: Consider snow drifting on leeward sides
- **Sliding snow**: Account for snow sliding off steep roofs
- **Ice dams**: Prevent ice dam formation through adequate ventilation and insulation

### 5.2 Ice Accretion

- **Structural members**: Consider ice accretion on exposed members (10-25 mm radial thickness)
- **Wind on ice-coated structures**: Combined wind and ice load per [ASCE 7](https://www.asce.org/)

---

## 6. Operational Considerations

### 6.1 Heating Systems

- **Building heating**: Adequate capacity for rapid warm-up
- **Snow melting**: Electric or hydronic snow melting for critical access areas
- **Pipe heat tracing**: Prevent freezing of water lines

### 6.2 Maintenance Access

- **Snow removal**: Design for snow storage and removal equipment access
- **Roof access**: Safe access for snow removal and maintenance
- **Anti-icing**: Apply anti-icing treatments for walkways and platforms
