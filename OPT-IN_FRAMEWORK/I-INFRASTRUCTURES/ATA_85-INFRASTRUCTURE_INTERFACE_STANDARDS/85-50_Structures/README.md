# 85-50_Structures

## Purpose

Physical infrastructure structures supporting the AMPEL360 BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft operations, including frames, housings, mounts, safety barriers, and ground-based facilities.

## Scope

This is a **cross-ATA root bucket** present in every ATA chapter. For ATA 85 (Infrastructure Interface Standards), this bucket contains **all physical structures** required for safe and efficient aircraft operations at airports, including:

- H₂ refueling infrastructure
- Battery charging stations
- Passenger boarding infrastructure (BWB-adapted)
- Ground support equipment facilities
- H₂ storage facilities
- Maintenance hangars
- Electrical infrastructure
- Safety zones and barriers
- Pavement and apron structures

## Key Design Principles

1. **Safety First**: H₂-compatible design with blast resistance and fire protection
2. **BWB-Specific**: Adapted for wide fuselage, multiple doors, large wing span
3. **Sustainability**: Low-carbon materials (≥50% reduction), circular design
4. **Modularity**: Adaptable to different airport configurations
5. **Resilience**: Robust against wind, seismic, thermal, and blast loads
