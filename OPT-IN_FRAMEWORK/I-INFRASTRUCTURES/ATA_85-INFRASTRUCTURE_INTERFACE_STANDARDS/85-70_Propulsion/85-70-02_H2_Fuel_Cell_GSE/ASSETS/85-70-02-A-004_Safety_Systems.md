## 1. Purpose

This document defines safety systems and protocols for hydrogen fuel cell Ground Support Equipment.

---

## 2. Safety System Architecture

### 2.1 Leak Detection and Mitigation

- **H₂ Sensors**: Multiple electrochemical or catalytic sensors
- **Location**: Tank compartment, fuel cell compartment, cabin
- **Detection Threshold**: 1% H₂ by volume (25% Lower Explosive Limit)
- **Response Actions**:
  - Activate ventilation fans
  - Close H₂ supply valves
  - Alert operator (audible and visual)
  - Log event for maintenance review

### 2.2 Fire Detection and Suppression

- **Flame Detectors**: UV or IR flame sensors
- **Heat Detectors**: Rate-of-rise and fixed-temperature
- **Suppression System**: Inert gas (nitrogen or CO₂) flooding
- **Manual Override**: Accessible fire extinguishers

### 2.3 Ventilation System

- **Forced Ventilation**: Electric fans in all H₂ compartments
- **Air Changes**: Minimum 10 air changes per hour
- **Activation**: Continuous during operation, triggered by leak detection
- **Power Source**: Independent battery backup

## 3. Operational Safety Protocols

### 3.1 Pre-Operation Checks

- Visual inspection of tanks and fittings
- Leak detection system self-test
- Ventilation system verification

### 3.2 Refueling Safety

- Grounding connection established
- No ignition sources within 5m
- Trained personnel only
- Emergency shutdown accessible

### 3.3 Emergency Procedures

- Immediate shutdown procedures
- Evacuation protocols
- Fire response procedures
- Incident reporting
