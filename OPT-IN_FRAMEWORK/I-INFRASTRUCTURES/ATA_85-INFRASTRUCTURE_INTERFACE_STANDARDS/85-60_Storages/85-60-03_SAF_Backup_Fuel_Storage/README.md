## Purpose

The SAF Backup Fuel Storage system provides infrastructure for sustainable aviation fuel (saf) storage for backup and hybrid propulsion aircraft to support AMPEL360 BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft operations and airport sustainability initiatives.

## Key Capabilities

- Safe and compliant storage per applicable regulations
- Environmental protection and spill containment
- Inventory management and tracking
- Integration with airport operational systems
- Lifecycle management and circularity

## Criticality

**Design Assurance Level:** DAL-B

**Rationale:** Storage system failures can impact:
- Operational availability and continuity
- Environmental compliance
- Personnel safety
- Regulatory compliance
