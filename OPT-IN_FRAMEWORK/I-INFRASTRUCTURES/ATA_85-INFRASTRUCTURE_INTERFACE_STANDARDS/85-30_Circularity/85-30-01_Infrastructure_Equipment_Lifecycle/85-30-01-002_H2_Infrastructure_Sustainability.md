## Document Information

- **Document ID**: 85-30-01-002_H2_Infrastructure_Sustainability
- **Title**: H₂ Infrastructure Sustainability
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Status**: Draft
- **Category**: Implementation Guide
- **ATA Chapter**: 85 - Infrastructure Interface Standards
- **Bucket**: 30 - Circularity

## Purpose

Defines lifecycle management strategies specific to hydrogen production, storage, distribution, and refueling infrastructure supporting BWB aircraft operations.

## Scope

This document covers implementation strategies, requirements, and best practices for the specified area within the AMPEL360 circularity framework.

## H₂ Infrastructure Components
### Production Systems (Electrolyzers)
- PEM or alkaline electrolyzer lifecycle (25-30 year design life)
- Stack replacement strategies (typically 10-15 years)
- [Green electricity sourcing](../85-30-03_Energy_Efficiency_and_Electrification/85-30-03-002_Renewable_Energy_Integration.md) requirements
### Storage Systems
- High-pressure storage vessels (700-900 bar, 30+ year life)
- Cryogenic liquid H₂ tanks (special materials, insulation lifecycle)
- Periodic inspection and recertification (per pressure vessel codes)
### Distribution Infrastructure
- Pipeline integrity management (corrosion monitoring, embrittlement prevention)
- Compressor stations (maintenance, efficiency optimization)
- Mobile bowsers (refueling vehicles - see [GSE lifecycle](85-30-01-001_GSE_Lifecycle_Management.md))
## Sustainability Metrics
- Carbon intensity of H₂ production (target: <1 kgCO₂e/kg H₂ for "green" certification)
- Water consumption (electrolysis requires ~9 liters/kg H₂)
- Equipment embodied carbon amortized over long service life
## Safety and Regulatory Compliance
- Compliance with [ISO 19880-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/69594.html) (H₂ refueling stations)
- [NFPA 2](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=2) (Hydrogen Technologies Code)
- Pressure equipment directives and inspections
