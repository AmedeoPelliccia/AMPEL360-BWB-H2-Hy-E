## Purpose

Provides circularity strategies for passenger boarding bridges (jetways) and aircraft stand equipment, considering BWB-specific geometric requirements.

## Scope

This document covers implementation strategies, requirements, and best practices for the specified area within the AMPEL360 circularity framework.

## Passenger Boarding Bridges (PBBs)
### Lifecycle Characteristics
- Design life: 30-40 years (structural)
- Major refurbishment cycles: 15-20 years
- Technology upgrades: 7-10 years (HVAC, controls, docking systems)
### BWB-Specific Adaptations
- Wide-body door spacing accommodations
- Multiple docking point configurations
- Enhanced access for emergency evacuation (see [ATA 85-00-01-003](../../85-00_GENERAL/85-00-01_Overview/85-00-01-003_Passenger_Evacuation_and_Rescue_Interfaces.md))
### Circular Strategies
- Modular components (cab, tunnel sections, wheels) for individual replacement
- [Remanufacturing of drive systems and HVAC](../85-30-02_Materials_and_Reuse/85-30-02-002_Component_Remanufacturing_Strategy.md)
- Steel structure recyclability >95%
## Aircraft Stand Equipment
### Chocks, Cones, and Safety Equipment
- Durable materials (UV-resistant plastics, powder-coated steel)
- Long service life (10-15 years with minimal maintenance)
- High recyclability at end-of-life
### Visual Docking Guidance Systems
- LED technology for energy efficiency and longevity
- [DPP integration](../85-30-00-004_DPP_Integration_for_Infrastructure.md) for calibration and maintenance tracking
