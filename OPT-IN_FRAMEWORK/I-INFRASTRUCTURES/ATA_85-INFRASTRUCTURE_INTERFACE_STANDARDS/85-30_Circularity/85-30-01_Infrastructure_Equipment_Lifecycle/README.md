# 85-30-01 Infrastructure Equipment Lifecycle

## Purpose

This section provides comprehensive guidance and specifications for managing the complete lifecycle of infrastructure equipment supporting AMPEL360 BWB aircraft operations, from initial requirements through end-of-life disposition.

## Scope

Covers all infrastructure equipment categories:
- Ground Support Equipment (GSE)
- Hydrogen production, storage, and distribution systems
- Passenger boarding bridges and aircraft stands
- Ground power and environmental control units
- Support facilities and fixed infrastructure

## Contents

- **[85-30-01-004 Maintenance for Longevity](85-30-01-004_Maintenance_for_Longevity.md)**
  - Preventive and predictive maintenance strategies
  - Condition-based monitoring and diagnostics
  - Maintenance optimization for extended service life
  - Repair vs. replace decision frameworks
  - Training and competency requirements

### Supporting Assets

Located in [ASSETS/](ASSETS/):

- **Lifecycle_Models/**: Equipment-specific lifecycle models, TCO calculations, environmental impact assessments
- **Maintenance_Schedules/**: Preventive maintenance schedules, inspection checklists, predictive maintenance algorithms
- **Replacement_Plans/**: Fleet replacement strategies, phase-out timelines, technology roadmaps

## Key Principles

1. **Design for Longevity**: All equipment procured with 15+ year design life targets
2. **Predictive Maintenance**: Condition-based approaches minimizing downtime and extending service life
3. **Modular Upgrades**: Technology refresh without full equipment replacement
4. **[Digital Product Passport](../85-30-00-004_DPP_Integration_for_Infrastructure.md) Integration**: Complete lifecycle traceability for all equipment
5. **Circular End-of-Life**: Redeployment, refurbishment, or recycling prioritized over disposal
