## Document Information

- **Document ID**: 85-30-00-001
- **Title**: Circularity Framework Overview
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Status**: Draft
- **Category**: Overview
- **ATA Chapter**: 85 - Infrastructure Interface Standards
- **Bucket**: 30 - Circularity

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Circularity Framework for AMPEL360 BWB infrastructure interfaces. It establishes the strategic approach to sustainability, lifecycle management, material circularity, and carbon accounting throughout the ground operations ecosystem supporting the hydrogen-electric BWB aircraft.

## Scope

The Circularity Framework encompasses:

- **Infrastructure Equipment Lifecycle**: Management of ground support equipment (GSE), hydrogen infrastructure, and airport interface systems from design through end-of-life
- **Materials and Reuse**: Selection, remanufacturing, recycling, and recovery of materials used in infrastructure systems
- **Energy Efficiency**: Electrification strategies, renewable energy integration, and energy optimization
- **H₂ Value Chain**: Green hydrogen production, distribution, and infrastructure sustainability
- **CO₂ Battery Systems**: Circular economy approaches for battery containers and energy storage systems
- **Carbon Accounting**: Comprehensive emissions tracking and reduction strategies for ground operations
- **Waste Management**: Zero-waste initiatives and resource recovery processes
- **Digital Product Passports**: Traceability and lifecycle data management for infrastructure components
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Partnership models and ecosystem development for circular economy implementation

## Strategic Context

### Why Circularity Matters for BWB Infrastructure

The AMPEL360 Blended Wing Body aircraft represents a paradigm shift in aviation sustainability through hydrogen-electric propulsion and CO₂ capture systems. However, the environmental benefits of the aircraft can only be fully realized when the supporting ground infrastructure operates on circular economy principles:

1. **Embodied Carbon**: Infrastructure equipment represents significant embodied carbon that must be minimized through lifecycle extension, reuse, and recycling
2. **Operational Carbon**: Ground operations (GSE, energy systems, facilities) contribute substantially to aviation's carbon footprint
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Scarce materials (rare earths, critical minerals) used in hydrogen and battery systems require circular management
4. **Regulatory Alignment**: Compliance with [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai), circular economy directives, and emerging sustainability regulations
5. **Economic Value**: Circular models reduce costs through extended asset life, materials recovery, and optimized resource use

### Alignment with Aviation Standards

This framework integrates with:

- [CS-25 (EASA)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) environmental and sustainability provisions
- [ICAO Annex 16](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/pages/annex16.aspx) Environmental Protection standards
- ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems
- ISO 14040/14044 Life Cycle Assessment standards
- [EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en)

## Framework Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Design for Circularity**: Infrastructure systems are designed from the outset for longevity, modularity, reuse, and recyclability
2. **Lifecycle Thinking**: All decisions consider full lifecycle impacts from raw material extraction through end-of-life
3. **Systems Integration**: Circularity strategies are integrated across aircraft, infrastructure, and operational systems
4. **Data-Driven Optimization**: [Digital Product Passports](85-30-00-004_DPP_Integration_for_Infrastructure.md) and real-time monitoring enable continuous improvement
5. **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Success requires coordination across airports, suppliers, energy providers, and regulators
