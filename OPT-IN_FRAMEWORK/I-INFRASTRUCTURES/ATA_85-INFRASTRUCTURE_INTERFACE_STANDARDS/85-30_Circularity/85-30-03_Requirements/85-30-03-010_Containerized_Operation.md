# RQ-85-30-05-010 — Containerized Operation

**Requirement ID**: RQ-85-30-05-010  
**Title**: Containerized Operation  
**Subsystem**: 85-30 Circularity  
**Parent ATA**: ATA 85 – Infrastructure Interface Standards  
**Status**: DRAFT  

---

## Description

The system shall operate autonomously within a standardized containerized footprint (e.g., ISO 20 ft or equivalent), including all capture, synthesis, purification, and packaging functions.

---

## Rationale

Containerized operation enables:
- **Mobility**: Deployment near airport aprons, test stands, or maintenance hangars
- **Modularity**: "Plug-and-play" integration with power, exhaust, and data interfaces
- **Scalability**: Replicable units for multi-site deployment in the AMPEL360 ecosystem

---

## Verification Method

- **Inspection**: Physical verification of container dimensions and compliance with ISO/ULD standards
- **Analysis**: Review of system integration documentation confirming all functions are contained within the footprint
