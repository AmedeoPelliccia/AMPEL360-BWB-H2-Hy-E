# RQ-85-30-05-012 — Integrated Quality Control

**Requirement ID**: RQ-85-30-05-012  
**Title**: Integrated Quality Control  
**Subsystem**: 85-30 Circularity  
**Parent ATA**: ATA 85 – Infrastructure Interface Standards  
**Status**: DRAFT  

---

## Description

The system shall include inline Quality Control capable of certifying that carbon produced meets defined specifications for use in battery applications.

---

## Rationale

Integrated QC ensures:
- **Material qualification**: Only battery-grade carbon (≥99.9% purity) proceeds to packaging
- **Process control**: Real-time feedback enables optimization of synthesis parameters
- **Traceability**: QC data anchors to each material batch via DPP records

---

## Verification Method

- **Test**: Perform qualification testing with known reference materials to verify QC accuracy
- **Analysis**: Review QC specifications against battery OEM requirements and industry standards

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The integrated QC system must be capable of measuring:
- **Purity (carbon)**: ≥ 99.9 wt% C
- **Ash content**: ≤ 0.05 wt%
- **Moisture**: ≤ 50 ppm
- **Structure**: Raman I(D)/I(G) ratio for graphitic order
- **Thermal stability**: TGA profiles vs. specification
