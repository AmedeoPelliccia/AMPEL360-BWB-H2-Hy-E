- **ATA Chapter**: 85 - Infrastructure Interface Standards

## Purpose

This document defines the standardization strategy and framework agreement approach for ATA 85 infrastructure interfaces. It establishes the basis for agreements with airports, air navigation service providers (ANSPs), operators, and infrastructure providers to ensure consistent, interoperable infrastructure deployment across the global network.

## Scope

This plan addresses:

- Service level agreement (SLA) templates
- Interface standardization commitments
- Cost-sharing and investment models
- Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with key partners
- Change management and configuration control

## Standardization Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Interoperability First**
- All infrastructure interfaces shall be interoperable across airports
- BWB aircraft can operate at any equipped airport without customization
- Ground equipment and systems are standardized globally
- Regional variations only for regulatory or environmental necessity

**2. Safety Through Standardization**
- Standardized interfaces reduce complexity and human error
- Common training and procedures across all locations
- Proven designs replicated consistently
- Safety case basis applies globally

**3. Economic Efficiency**
- Standardization reduces deployment costs
- Common supply chain and equipment
- Simplified support and maintenance
- Economies of scale in production

**4. Future-Proofing**
- Standards designed with technology evolution in mind
- Modular approach allows upgrades without full replacement
- Version control and backward compatibility
- Innovation pathways within standard framework

### Standardization Scope

## Cost-Sharing and Investment Models

### Investment Allocation Principles

**Infrastructure Provider Investments**:
- Supply-side infrastructure (H₂ production, pipelines, electrical grid)
- Revenue recovery through supply contracts (price per kg H₂, kWh, etc.)
- Long-term investment based on volume commitments

**Airport Investments**:
- Airport-side infrastructure (gates, aprons, terminals, safety equipment)
- Recovery through landing fees, terminal charges, or concession revenues
- Capital investment programs aligned with airport development

**Airline/Operator Investments**:
- Aircraft and onboard systems (outside scope of ATA 85)
- Operational training and procedures
- Recovery through ticket revenues and operational efficiency

**Shared Investments**:
- Interface equipment and systems benefiting multiple parties
- Co-investment or cost-sharing agreements
- Joint ownership or lease arrangements

### Cost-Sharing Models

**Model 1: Proportional Cost-Sharing**
- Costs allocated based on utilization or benefit
- Example: H₂ infrastructure costs shared 50% airport, 30% operator, 20% H₂ provider
- Transparent cost accounting and allocation methodology

**Model 2: Operator-Funded with Airport Facilitation**
- Operator funds infrastructure, airport provides land and facilitation
- Example: Airline invests in dedicated H₂ infrastructure at hub
- Airport provides site, permits, and long-term lease

**Model 3: Infrastructure Provider-Funded with Off-Take Agreements**
- Infrastructure provider funds deployment, recovers through supply contracts
- Example: H₂ provider builds infrastructure, guaranteed volume from operators
- Airport provides site and coordination

**Model 4: Public-Private Partnership (PPP)**
- Government or public entity co-invests for strategic or environmental goals
- Example: Airport authority and national government fund H₂ infrastructure
- Operators benefit from reduced infrastructure costs

### Financial Incentives

**Early Adopter Incentives**:
- Reduced landing fees or charges for BWB operations (initial period)
- Priority gate assignment and scheduling
- Marketing and promotional support

**Volume Commitments**:
- Discounted rates for committed volume (movements, H₂, electricity)
- Graduated pricing based on utilization
- Long-term contract security

**Performance-Based Incentives**:
- Bonuses for exceeding availability or performance targets
- Penalties for service level failures (subject to SLA)
- Shared savings from efficiency improvements
