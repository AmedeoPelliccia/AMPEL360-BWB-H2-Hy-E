- Wide door spacing (lateral distribution)
- Emergency exit distribution for rapid evacuation

**Terminal Interface Implications**:
- Multiple boarding bridges may be required
- Standard jetway compatibility limited
- Evacuation access more complex
- Ground-level access important for regional operations

### Regulatory Requirements

- Suitable for wide-body jetway infrastructure
- Requires two compatible gate positions

**Configuration B: Single Wide Jetway** (for medium hubs)
- Single extended-width jetway
- Access to primary door cluster
- Standard turnaround time acceptable
- Most gates compatible with adapters

**Configuration C: Ground Boarding** (regional/remote stands)
