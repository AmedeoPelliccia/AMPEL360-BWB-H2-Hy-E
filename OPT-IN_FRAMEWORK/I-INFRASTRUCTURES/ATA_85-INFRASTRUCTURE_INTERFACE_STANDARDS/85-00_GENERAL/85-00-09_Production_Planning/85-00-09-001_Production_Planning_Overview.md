- **Mitigation**: Framework agreements with committed airports; flexible deployment sequencing; cost-sharing mechanisms

**3. Regulatory Approval Delays**
- **Risk**: Certification and permitting processes exceed planned timelines
- **Mitigation**: Early regulatory engagement; standardized approval packages; parallel approval processes

**4. Technology Immaturity**
