# 85-00-09_Production_Planning

## Purpose

This folder defines the **production planning and industrialization strategy** for  
**ATA 85 – Infrastructure Interface Standards**, covering how airport, ground, and energy infrastructure interfaces for the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ / CO₂ battery ecosystem are deployed, scaled, and stabilized across the global network.

It is **Stage 9 (Production Planning)** of the **A-LIVE-GP – Aircraft Lifecycle Industrialization and Validation Executive General Plan** for ATA 85.

## Scope

In scope:

- Master production planning for infrastructure interface standards:
  - H₂ infrastructure interfaces (storage, transfer, refuelling, safety zones)
  - CO₂ battery infrastructure (docking, swap/charge points, logistics)
  - Ground support equipment (GSE) power and data interfaces
  - Passenger boarding and evacuation interfaces
- Ramp-up strategy across airports (waves, regions, operators)
- Capacity and throughput planning for interfaces (turnaround, energy flows)
- Standardization and framework agreements with airports, operators, and suppliers
- Integration with **02-XX Operational Information** and **99-XX Circularity/Sustainability** planning

Out of scope:

- Detailed physical design of assets (covered in **85-00-04_Design**)
- Detailed safety analysis (covered in **85-00-02_Safety**)
- Detailed certification dossiers (covered in **85-00-10_Certification**)
