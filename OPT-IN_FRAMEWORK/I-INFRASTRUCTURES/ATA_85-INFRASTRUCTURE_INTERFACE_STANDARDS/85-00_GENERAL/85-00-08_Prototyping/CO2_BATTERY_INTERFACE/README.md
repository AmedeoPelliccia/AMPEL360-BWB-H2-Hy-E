# CO2_BATTERY_INTERFACE – Closed-Loop CO₂ Battery Ground Interface

## 1. Mission

Validate the closed-loop CO₂ battery ground interface through prototypes addressing battery dock coupling, buffer tank exchange, thermal management, and operational integration for the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## 2. Key Documents

- **[85-00-08-CO2-001 CO₂ Battery Dock Prototype](./85-00-08-CO2-001_CO2_Battery_Dock_Prototype.md)** – Mechanical coupling, leak-tight seals, and automated connection validation
- **[85-00-08-CO2-002 CO₂ Buffer Exchange Pilot Trials](./85-00-08-CO2-002_CO2_Buffer_Exchange_Pilot_Trials.md)** – Rapid buffer tank exchange and closed-loop integrity testing

## 3. Scope

CO₂ battery interface prototyping addresses the novel closed-loop CO₂ battery system:
- **Battery dock coupling**: Automated or manual connection to aircraft CO₂ battery
- **Buffer tank exchange**: Rapid swap of CO₂ buffer tanks during turnaround
- **Closed-loop integrity**: Leak-tight system preventing CO₂ loss
- **Thermal management**: Temperature control during exchange
- **Operational procedures**: Ground crew training and safety
