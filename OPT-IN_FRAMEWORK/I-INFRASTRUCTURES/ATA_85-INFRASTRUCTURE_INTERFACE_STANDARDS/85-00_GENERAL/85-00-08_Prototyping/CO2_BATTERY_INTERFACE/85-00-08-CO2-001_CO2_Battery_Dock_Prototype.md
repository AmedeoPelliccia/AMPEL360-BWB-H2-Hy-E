# 85-00-08-CO2-001 CO₂ Battery Dock Prototype

## 1. Purpose

Define the CO₂ battery dock prototype program for validating the ground interface coupling mechanism, leak-tight connections, and automated docking procedures.

## 2. Scope

- Mechanical coupling design and testing
- Leak-tight seal validation
- Automated alignment and connection
- Emergency disconnect procedures

## 3. Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                                | Target              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Coupling Time**                  | ≤ 5 min             |
| **Leak Rate**                      | ≤ 10 ppm CO₂        |
| **Alignment Accuracy**             | ± 5 mm              |
