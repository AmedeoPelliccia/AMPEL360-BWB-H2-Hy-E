- Integration with airport systems (gate management, GSE dispatch, operations control)

**Deliverables**:
- Pilot gate trial report
- Operational procedures (finalized)
- Training materials for ground handlers
- Turnaround time statistics and analysis

### Phase 3: Full Operational Field Trial (TRL 8)
**Duration**: 3-6 months  
**Location**: Multiple partner airports

**Activities**:
- Regular turnaround operations (e.g., daily or multiple times per week)
- Diverse scenarios (domestic, international, short turnaround, long turnaround)
- Weather and operational variability (delays, irregular ops, diversions)
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

**Deliverables**:
- Field trial analysis report
- Certification evidence (turnaround time, safety, operational feasibility)
- Lessons learned and best practices
- Transition plan to production operations
