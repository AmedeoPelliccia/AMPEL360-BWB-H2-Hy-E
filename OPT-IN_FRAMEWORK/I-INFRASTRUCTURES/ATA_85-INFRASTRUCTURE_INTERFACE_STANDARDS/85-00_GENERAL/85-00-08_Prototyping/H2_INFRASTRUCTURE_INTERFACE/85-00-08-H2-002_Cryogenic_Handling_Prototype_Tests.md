# 85-00-08-H2-002 Cryogenic Handling Prototype Tests

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the cryogenic handling prototype test program for validating thermal management, material compatibility, personnel safety, and operational procedures for liquid hydrogen (LH2) at -253°C.

## 2. Scope

Cryogenic handling tests address:
- Material compatibility at cryogenic temperatures
- Thermal management and insulation effectiveness
- Ice formation and condensation control
- Personnel safety equipment and training
- Emergency procedures for cryogenic spills

## 3. Test Categories

### 3.1 Material Compatibility
- Thermal cycling of seals, gaskets, and structural materials
- Brittle fracture testing at -253°C
- Long-term exposure and degradation assessment

### 3.2 Thermal Management
- Insulation effectiveness (vacuum-jacketed vs. foam)
- Boil-off rate measurement and control
- Thermal stress on aircraft structure
- Heat leak identification and mitigation

### 3.3 Personnel Safety
- PPE effectiveness (cryogenic gloves, face shields, aprons)
- Training program validation
- Emergency response procedures (spills, injuries)
- Human factors and ergonomics in cold environment

## 4. Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                                | Target              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
