# 85-00-08-DT-001 Interface Digital Twin Prototype

## 1. Purpose

Define the infrastructure interface digital twin prototype for virtual representation, simulation, and analysis of airport and ground infrastructure interactions with the BWB aircraft.

## 2. Scope

- Virtual model of airport infrastructure (gates, apron, GSE)
- Aircraft-infrastructure interaction simulation
- Sensor data integration from physical prototypes
- Predictive analysis and optimization
- Scenario library for nominal and off-nominal operations

## 3. Digital Twin Architecture

### 3.1 Model Components
- **Geometry**: 3D models of airport, aircraft, GSE
- **Physics**: Dynamics, thermal, fluid flow
- **Control**: Automation and control system logic
- **Environment**: Weather, lighting, obstacles

### 3.2 Data Flows
- **Input**: Sensor data, operational parameters, scenarios
- **Processing**: Real-time simulation, analysis, optimization
- **Output**: Predictions, KPIs, visualizations, alerts

## 4. Key Performance Indicators
