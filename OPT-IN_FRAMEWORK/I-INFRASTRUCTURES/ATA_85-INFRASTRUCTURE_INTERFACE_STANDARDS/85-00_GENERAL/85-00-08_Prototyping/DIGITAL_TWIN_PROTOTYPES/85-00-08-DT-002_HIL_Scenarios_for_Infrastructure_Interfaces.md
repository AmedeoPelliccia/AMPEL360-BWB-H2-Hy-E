# 85-00-08-DT-002 HIL Scenarios for Infrastructure Interfaces

## 1. Purpose

Define hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test scenarios for validating real control systems and hardware interfacing with simulated infrastructure environment.

## 2. Scope

- HIL testbed configuration
- Scenario library (nominal, off-nominal, emergency)
- Hardware interfaces (sensors, actuators, controllers)
- Performance validation and certification evidence

## 3. HIL Test Categories

### 3.1 Control System Validation
- Refueling control system (H2, conventional)
- GSE dispatch and scheduling system
- Boarding bridge automated alignment
- Safety monitoring and emergency shutdown

### 3.2 Sensor Integration
- Wingtip proximity sensors
- Leak detection systems (H2, CO₂)
- Camera systems for ground maneuvering
- Environmental sensors (weather, temperature, pressure)

### 3.3 Human-Machine Interface
- Pilot displays and controls
- Ground crew tablets and interfaces
- Airport operations center dashboards

## 4. Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                                | Target              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **HIL Test Scenarios Executed**    | ≥ 50                |
| **Hardware-Software Sync**         | ≤ 10 ms latency     |
| **Failure Detection Rate**         | ≥ 95%               |
