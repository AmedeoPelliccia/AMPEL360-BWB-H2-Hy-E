# 85-00-08-PAX-001 Boarding Flow Prototype

## 1. Purpose

Define the boarding flow prototype program for optimizing passenger boarding procedures, minimizing boarding time, and validating human factors for the BWB cabin.

## 2. Scope

- Boarding procedure optimization
- Passenger flow simulation and timing
- Door and aisle configuration validation
- Cabin crew positioning and assistance
- Accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility

## 3. Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                                | Target              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Boarding Time (300 PAX)**        | ≤ 25 min            |
| **Passenger Satisfaction**         | ≥ 4.0/5.0           |
| **Boarding Conflicts**             | ≤ 3 per boarding    |
