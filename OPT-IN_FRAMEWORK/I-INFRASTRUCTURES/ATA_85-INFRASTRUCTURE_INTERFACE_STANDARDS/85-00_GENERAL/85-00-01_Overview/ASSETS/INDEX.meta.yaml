notes: |
  All assets are currently placeholders pending creation by design team, technical illustrators,
  and systems engineering team. Placeholders include descriptions of expected content to guide
  asset creation. This INDEX will be updated as assets are completed.
  
  Priority for completion:
  1. 85-00-01-A-002 (BWB Infrastructure Context SVG) - Required for high-level overviews and presentations
  2. 85-00-01-A-005 (Cross-ATA Interface Table) - Required for systems engineering and certification planning
  3. 85-00-01-A-003 (H₂ and CO₂ Interface Layers) - Required for detailed energy interface specifications
  4. 85-00-01-A-004 (Evacuation Interface Scenarios) - Required for CS-25.803 certification demonstrations
  5. 85-00-01-A-001 (BWB Infrastructure Context drawio source) - Source for A-002, lower priority if SVG created directly
