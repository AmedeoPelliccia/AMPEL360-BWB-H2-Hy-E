# Placeholder for 85-00-01-A-004_Evacuation_Interface_Scenarios.svg

This file is a placeholder for the evacuation interface scenarios diagram.

## Expected Content

Multiple scenario views showing:

### Normal Evacuation Scenario
- All 16 exits (12 Type A doors + 4 Type III overwing)
- Slide deployment zones (10m x 5m per door)
- Passenger flow paths to assembly points (100m forward/aft, 30m lateral)
- ARFF vehicle approach routes

### Degraded Scenario (50% Exits Blocked)
- 8 exits available (worst-case per CS-25.803)
- Alternate evacuation routes
- Evacuation time analysis (still < 90 seconds)

### Emergency Scenario with H₂ Considerations
- H₂ refuelling zone marked (10m exclusion)
- Safe evacuation routes avoiding H₂ zone
- ARFF positioning for H₂ fire response

### Rescue Vehicle Access
- ARFF truck positioning (20m from aircraft, 45° approach)
- Aerial platform reach zones (8-12m height capability)
- Ambulance access to slide termination points
