# Placeholder for 85-00-01-A-003_H2_and_CO2_Interface_Layers.svg

This file is a placeholder for the layered diagram showing H₂ and CO₂ battery interfaces.

## Expected Content

Layered architectural view showing:

### Physical Layer
- H₂ connectors (SAE AS50881)
- CO₂ battery docking mechanism
- Mechanical mounting points

### Signal and Control Layer
- Electrical interfaces (power, control signals)
- Safety interlocks (grounding, leak detection, emergency stop)
- Valve control signals

### Data and Monitoring Layer
- Real-time telemetry (CAN bus for H₂, Ethernet for CO₂)
- Status monitoring (pressure, temperature, flow, SOC)
- Event logging

### Operational and Safety Layer
- Standard operating procedures
- Emergency response protocols
- Safety management system integration
