# 85-00-14-001 — Ops/Std/Sustain Overview

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Operations, Standards, and Sustainment Model** for [ATA Chapter 85 – Infrastructure Interface Standards](https://www.ata.org/resources/specifications) within the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft program.

It describes how infrastructure interfaces are operated, maintained, and evolved in service, closing the lifecycle loop of the **A-LIVE-GP (Aircraft Lifecycle Industrialization and Validation Executive General Plan)** framework.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Covered Infrastructure Interfaces

This sustainment framework applies to all ATA 85 infrastructure interface domains:

1. **H₂ Infrastructure** — Hydrogen refuelling, storage, and safety systems
2. **CO₂ Battery Interface** — CO₂ battery charging and closed-loop operations
3. **Airport Interface** — Gates, bridges, power, data communications
4. **Ground Services Interface** — GSE connections, towing, de-icing equipment
5. **Passenger Boarding & Evacuation** — Boarding bridges, emergency egress paths

### 2.2 Key Activities

- Development and maintenance of **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**
- Monitoring of **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Sustainment planning** for interface hardware and systems
- **Change and upgrade management** for evolving infrastructure standards
- **Incident and problem management** at the aircraft–infrastructure boundary
- **Knowledge management** and lessons learned feedback to design and requirements

## 3. Role in A-LIVE-GP Lifecycle

### 3.1 Position in 14-Stage Framework

**Stage 14 – Ops / Standards / Sustain** is the final stage of the A-LIVE-GP lifecycle:

3. [Requirements](../85-00-03_Requirements)
4. [Design](../85-00-04_Design)
5. [Interfaces](../85-00-05_Interfaces)
6. [Engineering](../85-00-06_Engineering)
7. [V&V](../85-00-07_V_AND_V)
8. [Prototyping](../85-00-08_Prototyping)
9. [Production Planning](../85-00-09_Production_Planning)
10. [Certification](../85-00-10_Certification)
11. [EIS/Versions/Tags](../85-00-11_EIS_Versions_Tags)
12. [Services](../85-00-12_Services)
13. [Subsystems/Components](../85-00-13_Subsystems_Components)
14. **Ops / Standards / Sustain** (this stage)

### 3.2 Feedback Loop

Stage 14 closes the loop by:

- Collecting operational data and lessons learned
- Feeding back insights to [Requirements](../85-00-03_Requirements), [Design](../85-00-04_Design), and [Safety](../85-00-02_Safety)
- Driving continuous improvement through change requests and upgrades
- Supporting [ATA 99 (Circularity, Carbon)](../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENICS_SYSTEMS/ATA_99-CARBON_ACCOUNTING) and [ATA 95 (DPP)](../../../../N-NEURAL_NETWORKS_USERS_TRACEABILITY/ATA_95-DIGITAL_PRODUCT_PASSPORT_NEURAL_NETWORKS) data flows

---

## 4. Operational Standards

### 4.1 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

SOPs define:

- **Pre-operation checklists** for infrastructure readiness
- **Connection and disconnection sequences** for H₂, CO₂, power, and data
- **Safety protocols** for ground crew and airport personnel
- **Emergency response procedures** for interface-related incidents

See [85-00-14-002_Operational_Standards_and_SOPs.md](./85-00-14-002_Operational_Standards_and_SOPs.md) for details.

### 4.2 Service Levels and KPIs

Key metrics include:

- **Infrastructure availability** at gates and stands
- **Turnaround time efficiency** for H₂/CO₂ servicing
- **Interface-related delays** and incident rates
- **Energy performance** and sustainability metrics

See [85-00-14-003_Service_Levels_and_KPIs.md](./85-00-14-003_Service_Levels_and_KPIs.md) for KPI definitions.

---

## 5. Sustainment Strategy

### 5.1 Maintenance and Lifecycle Management

Sustainment activities include:

- **Scheduled maintenance** of interface hardware (connectors, couplings, sensors)
- **Mid-life upgrades** for new H₂/CO₂ technologies
- **Obsolescence management** for data communication standards
- **Coordination with airport infrastructure upgrade cycles**

See [85-00-14-005_Lifecycle_Change_and_Upgrade_Management.md](./85-00-14-005_Lifecycle_Change_and_Upgrade_Management.md).

### 5.2 Sustainability and Circularity

Integration with [ATA 99 (Circularity, Carbon & Recycling)](../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENICS_SYSTEMS/ATA_99-CARBON_ACCOUNTING):

- **Carbon accounting** for infrastructure operations
- **Recycling and refurbishment** of interface hardware
- **Digital Product Passport (DPP)** data capture from ground operations
- **Circular economy principles** applied to GSE and ground equipment

See [85-00-14-004_Sustainability_and_Circularity_Strategy.md](./85-00-14-004_Sustainability_and_Circularity_Strategy.md).

## 6. Incident and Problem Management

### 6.1 Incident Classification

Infrastructure interface incidents are classified by:

- **Severity** — Safety-critical, operational delay, minor
- **Domain** — H₂, CO₂, power, data, passenger interface
- **Root cause location** — Aircraft-side, infrastructure-side, or interface protocol

### 6.2 Problem Management Process

1. **Incident reporting** via operational data capture systems
2. **Root cause analysis** with input from aircraft and airport teams
3. **Corrective actions** — immediate fixes and long-term solutions
4. **Knowledge base updates** to prevent recurrence

See [85-00-14-006_Incident_Problem_and_Risk_Management.md](./85-00-14-006_Incident_Problem_and_Risk_Management.md).

---

## 7. Knowledge Management and Lessons Learned

### 7.1 Operational Feedback Loop

Data flows from operations back to:

- **Requirements updates** ([85-00-03](../85-00-03_Requirements)) — new interface standards
- **Design improvements** ([85-00-04](../85-00-04_Design)) — refined interface specifications
- **Safety enhancements** ([85-00-02](../85-00-02_Safety)) — updated risk assessments

### 7.2 Best Practices Repository

A central knowledge base captures:

- **Successful interface implementations** at various airports
- **Lessons learned** from operational incidents
- **Training materials** for ground crew and airport personnel
- **Standardized templates** for SOPs and checklists

See [85-00-14-007_Knowledge_Management_and_Lessons_Learned.md](./85-00-14-007_Knowledge_Management_and_Lessons_Learned.md).
