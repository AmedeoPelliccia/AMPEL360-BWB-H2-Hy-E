# 85-00-14-CO2-002 — CO₂ Battery Sustainment Plan

## Purpose

This document defines the sustainment strategy for **CO₂ battery infrastructure interfaces** supporting AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

**Note**: This is a placeholder document. Detailed sustainment planning for CO₂ battery equipment lifecycle, maintenance programs, technology upgrades, and circular economy integration to be developed.

## Scope (To Be Defined)

- Preventive and corrective maintenance programs
- CO₂ battery technology upgrade roadmap
- CO₂ sourcing and sustainability (integration with [ATA 99](../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENICS_SYSTEMS/ATA_99-CARBON_ACCOUNTING))
- Equipment end-of-life and recycling strategies
