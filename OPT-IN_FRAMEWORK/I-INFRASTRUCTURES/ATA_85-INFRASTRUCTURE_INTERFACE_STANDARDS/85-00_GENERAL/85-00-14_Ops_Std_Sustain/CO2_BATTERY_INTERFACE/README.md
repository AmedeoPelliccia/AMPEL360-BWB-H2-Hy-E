# CO2_BATTERY_INTERFACE — Operational Standards and Sustainment

## Purpose

This folder contains **operational standards, procedures, and sustainment plans** for **CO₂ battery infrastructure interfaces** supporting the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft.

## Scope

### CO₂ Battery Interface Operations

- CO₂ battery charging and servicing procedures
- Closed-loop CO₂ management and safety protocols
- Thermal management during ground operations
- Equipment lifecycle and sustainability

## Contents

### Core Documents (To Be Developed)

- `85-00-14-CO2-001_CO2_Battery_Ops_Standards.md` — Operational standards and SOPs for CO₂ battery interfaces
- `85-00-14-CO2-002_CO2_Battery_Sustainment_Plan.md` — Lifecycle management and sustainment strategy

### ASSETS Folder

- **SOPs/** — CO₂ battery charging procedures, safety protocols
- **Checklists/** — Pre-charge checks, thermal management verification
- **KPIs_Dashboards/** — Battery performance, charging efficiency metrics
- **Sustainability_Reports/** — CO₂ sourcing, carbon footprint, circularity data

## Integration

Integrates with global [85-00-14_Ops_Std_Sustain](../) framework and links to [ATA 99 (Carbon Accounting)](../../../../../T-TECHNOLOGY_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENICS_SYSTEMS/ATA_99-CARBON_ACCOUNTING) for sustainability tracking.

## Status

- **Phase**: CO₂ Battery Ops Framework (A-LIVE-GP Stage 14)
- **Maturity**: `DRAFT` — Skeleton structure; content to be developed
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-21

## Document Control

- **Folder Owner**: CO₂ Battery Operations Lead
- **Repository**: `AMPEL360-BWB-H2-Hy-E`
- **AI assistance**: GitHub Copilot, prompted by **Amedeo Pelliccia**.
