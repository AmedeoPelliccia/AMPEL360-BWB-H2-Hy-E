# ATA 85-00-06: Engineering

## 1. Mission
The 85-00-06 layer consolidates the engineering assumptions, methods, and analytical evidence that translate the interface requirements in [85-00-05](../85-00-05_Interfaces/README.md) into verifiable solutions for the AMPEL360 BWB H2-Hybrid program.

## 2. Structure
*   **[General Engineering Set](./)** – Overview documents 001-005.
*   **[MASTER](./MASTER/README.md)** – Shared assumptions and parameter libraries.
*   **[AIRPORT_INTERFACE_ENGINEERING](./AIRPORT_INTERFACE_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Clearance, stand, and pavement studies.
*   **[H2_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING](./H2_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Refuelling system sizing and safety.
*   **[CO2_BATTERY_ENGINEERING](./CO2_BATTERY_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Cryogenic CO2 logistics and storage engineering.
*   **[GROUND_SERVICES_ENGINEERING](./GROUND_SERVICES_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – GPU/PCA/GSE integration studies.
*   **[PAX_BOARDING_EVAC_ENGINEERING](./PAX_BOARDING_EVAC_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Boarding and evacuation modelling.
*   **[DIGITAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING](./DIGITAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Data and cyber engineering analyses.
*   **[ENERGY_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING](./ENERGY_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENGINEERING/README.md)** – Grid, microgrid, and renewable integration.

## 3. Governance
Engineering deliverables follow [SAE ARP4754A](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp4754a/) development assurance guidance, and trace requirements to verification evidence through the OPT-IN lifecycle.
