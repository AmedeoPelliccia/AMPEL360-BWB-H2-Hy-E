# 85-00-03-EMERG-002 — H₂ and Energy System Emergency Response Requirements

## 1. Requirement Statement

ARFF personnel and equipment **SHALL** be trained and equipped for H₂ and CO₂ battery emergencies:
- **H₂ Fire Suppression**: Specialized firefighting foam and ventilation equipment
- **H₂ Leak Detection**: Portable H₂ detectors (sensitivity ≥ 25% LEL)
- **CO₂ Battery Incidents**: Thermal runaway response procedures and equipment
- **Training**: ARFF personnel trained in H₂ and battery emergency procedures (annual recurrent training)

## 2. Rationale

Hydrogen and CO₂ battery systems introduce novel hazards requiring specialized emergency response capabilities not standard in conventional aircraft firefighting.
