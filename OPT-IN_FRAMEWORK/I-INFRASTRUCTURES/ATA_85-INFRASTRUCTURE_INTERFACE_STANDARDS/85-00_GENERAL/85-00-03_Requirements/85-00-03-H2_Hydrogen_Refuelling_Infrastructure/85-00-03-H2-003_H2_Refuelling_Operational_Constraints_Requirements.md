# 85-00-03-H2-003 — H₂ Refuelling Operational Constraints Requirements

## 1. Requirement Statement

During hydrogen refuelling operations, the following safety zones and operational constraints **SHALL** be maintained:
- **Safety Zone**: Minimum 10-meter exclusion radius around refuelling point (no ignition sources, personnel, or equipment)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Ground service activities (passenger boarding, catering) permitted outside safety zone only
- **Ventilation**: Adequate ventilation or H₂ detection systems in enclosed or semi-enclosed refuelling areas
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems within 2 seconds

## 2. Rationale

Hydrogen is highly flammable (flammability range 4%-75% in air) and requires strict safety protocols to mitigate risks of fire or explosion during refuelling. Safety zones ensure:
- Separation from ignition sources and personnel
- Emergency response access
- Controlled environment for leak detection and mitigation

## 3. Category

- **Requirement Type**: Safety — Operational Constraints
- **Domain**: Hydrogen Refuelling Infrastructure
- **ATA**: 85-00-03_Requirements / H2

- **Industry Best Practices** — Hydrogen fuelling station safety guidelines
- **Regulatory Requirements** — Local and national hydrogen safety regulations

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Safety zone radius: ≥ 10 meters
- [ ] H₂ detection systems in refuelling areas (alert at 25% LEL)
- [ ] Emergency shutdown systems tested (response time < 2 seconds)
- [ ] Operational procedures prohibit ignition sources in safety zone
- [ ] Ground crew training on H₂ safety completed
- [ ] Emergency response plans coordinated with airport fire rescue

## 6. Verification Method

- **Method**: Demonstration + Test + Inspection
- **Evidence**: Safety zone validation, emergency shutdown tests, operational procedure demonstrations, crew training records

## 7. Traceability

- **Upstream**: Safety analyses (ATA 85-00-02_Safety)
- **Horizontal**: Emergency procedures (ATA 85-00-03-EMERG)
- **Downstream**: TC-85-03-H2-003-A (safety zone validation), TC-85-03-H2-003-B (emergency shutdown test)
