# 85-00-03-GEN — General Airport Infrastructure Compatibility

## Purpose

This folder contains requirements for the **General Airport Infrastructure Compatibility** of the AMPEL360 BWB H₂ Hy-E aircraft. These requirements define the physical compatibility of the aircraft with standard airport infrastructure, including movement areas, parking stands, and general operational facilities.

## Scope

### Covered Topics

- **Runway Requirements**: Length, width, strength, and surface conditions
- **Taxiway and Apron**: Clearances, turning radii, and pavement strength
- **Aircraft Parking Stands**: Dimensions, markings, and operational constraints
- **Airport Classification**: Compatibility with ICAO aerodrome reference codes
- **Ground Movement**: Procedures, constraints, and navigation aid compatibility
- **Pavement Loading**: Bearing strength requirements and load distribution

### Applicable Standards

- **[ICAO Annex 14](https://www.icao.int/safety/pages/annex-14.aspx)** — Aerodromes: Design and Operations
- **[EASA CS-ADR-DSN](https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/aerodromes)** — Certification Specifications for Aerodrome Design
