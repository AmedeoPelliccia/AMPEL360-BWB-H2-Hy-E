## 1. Requirement Statement

Ground service equipment **SHALL** access aircraft service points for turnaround operations:
- **Catering**: Access to forward and aft galley doors (heights 2.0m - 3.5m)
- **Cargo**: Cargo door access (belly cargo compartments)
- **Water/Waste**: Potable water and waste servicing access
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple ground service vehicles operating simultaneously outside H₂ safety zone

## 2. Rationale

Efficient turnaround requires concurrent ground service operations (catering, cargo, cleaning, water/waste) to achieve 45-minute target.
