# 85-00-05-701: Grid and Microgrid Connection Interface

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the interface between the airport's electrical grid (or microgrid) and the aircraft's charging/power systems.

## 2. Grid Characteristics
*   **Voltage:** Medium Voltage (MV) distribution to stand.
*   **Frequency:** 50/60Hz (converted to 400Hz or DC at stand).
*   **Capacity:** Peak load [Value] kVA per stand.

## 3. Requirements
*   **REQ-E-001:** The stand power supply shall handle the peak charging load of the aircraft batteries.
*   **REQ-E-002:** Smart grid protocols ([IEC 61850](https://www.iec.ch/search?q=IEC%2061850)) shall be used for load balancing.
