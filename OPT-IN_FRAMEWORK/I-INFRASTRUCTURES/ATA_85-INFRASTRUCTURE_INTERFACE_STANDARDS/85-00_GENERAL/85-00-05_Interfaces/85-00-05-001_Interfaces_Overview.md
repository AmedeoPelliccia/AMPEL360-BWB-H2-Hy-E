# 85-00-05-001: Interfaces Overview

## 1. Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of the interface philosophy for the AMPEL360 BWB H2-Hybrid Aircraft. It establishes the principles for integrating the aircraft with existing and future airport infrastructure.

## 2. Scope
The scope covers all points of interaction between the aircraft and the ground environment, including:
*   **Physical Interfaces:** Mechanical connections, geometric clearances, and load-bearing surfaces.
*   **Fluid/Gas Interfaces:** Hydrogen refuelling, CO2 offloading, water, and waste services.
*   **Electrical Interfaces:** Ground power, charging, and earthing.
*   **Data Interfaces:** Digital communication for operations, maintenance, and turnaround management.

## 3. Interface Philosophy
The design follows a "Smart & Modular" approach:
1.  **Standardization:** Utilizing existing aerospace standards ([ISO](https://www.iso.org/), [SAE](https://www.sae.org/), [IATA](https://www.iata.org/)) where applicable.
2.  **Safety First:** Prioritizing safety zones for H2 and high-voltage systems.
3.  **Efficiency:** Minimizing turnaround time through optimized service point locations.
4.  **Sustainability:** Enabling zero-emission ground operations.
