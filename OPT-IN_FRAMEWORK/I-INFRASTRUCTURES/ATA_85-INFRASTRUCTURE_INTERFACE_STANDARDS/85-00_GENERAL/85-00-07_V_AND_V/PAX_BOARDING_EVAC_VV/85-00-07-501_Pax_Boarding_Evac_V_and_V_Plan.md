# 85-00-07-501: Passenger Boarding and Evacuation V&V Plan

## 1. Objective
Verify and validate passenger boarding interfaces and evacuation systems to meet airworthiness requirements and operational efficiency.

## 2. Applicable Standards
- [CS-25.783](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) – Doors
- [CS-25.803](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) – Emergency Evacuation
- [CS-25.807](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) – Emergency Exits
- [CS-25.809](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) – Emergency Exit Arrangement
- [FAA AC 25.803-1A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/) – Emergency Evacuation Demonstrations
- ISO 23599 – Assistive products for blind and vision-impaired persons

## 3. Test Strategy
### 3.1 Boarding Interface Verification (Unit/Integration)
- **Door Sill Height**: Compatibility with standard PBBs (height range 2-5 m)
- **Door Width**: Minimum effective width per CS-25.783
- **Threshold Accessibility**: Step height, handrails, lighting

### 3.2 Evacuation System Verification (System)
- **Slide Deployment**: Time, reliability, inflation pressure
- **Slide Performance**: Descent rate, capacity (persons/minute)
- **Exit Marking**: Photoluminescent signs, emergency lighting

### 3.3 Evacuation Demonstration (Acceptance)
- **Full Evacuation Test**: 90 seconds with representative passengers per CS-25.803
- **Test Conditions**: Darkened cabin, 50% exits blocked, no prior knowledge of blocked exits
- **Pass Criteria**: All passengers evacuated within 90 seconds

## 4. Test Environment
- **Mockup Facility**: Full-scale fuselage section with operational doors and slides
- **Test Subjects**: Representative passenger demographics (age, mobility, size)
- **Instrumentation**: Video cameras, timing systems, exit counters

## 5. Success Criteria
- **Evacuation Time**: ≤ 90 seconds (CS-25.803)
- **Slide Deployment**: ≤ 10 seconds (target)
- **Boarding Time**: Competitive with current aircraft (≤ 20 minutes for full load)
- **Accessibility**: PRM can board/evacuate with minimal assistance

## 6. Schedule
- **Mockup Tests**: Months 30-36
- **Slide Certification**: Months 36-42
- **Full Evacuation Demo**: Month 48 (Type Certification milestone)

## 7. Deliverables
- Test procedures: [85-00-07-A-501](./ASSETS/85-00-07-A-501_Evacuation_Test_Procedures.pdf)
- Test reports: [85-00-07-A-502](./ASSETS/85-00-07-A-502_Evacuation_Test_Reports.xlsx)
- Video documentation of evacuation demonstration
