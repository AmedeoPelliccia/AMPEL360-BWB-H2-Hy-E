# Passenger Boarding and Evacuation V&V

## 1. Mission
Verification and validation of passenger boarding interfaces, evacuation systems, and emergency egress procedures.

## 2. Key Documents
*   [Passenger Boarding/Evacuation V&V Plan](./85-00-07-501_Pax_Boarding_Evac_V_and_V_Plan.md)
*   [Evacuation Time and Capacity Verification](./85-00-07-502_Evacuation_Time_and_Capacity_Verification.md)
*   [Passenger Flow Simulation Validation](./85-00-07-503_Passenger_Flow_Simulation_Validation.md)

## 3. Test Scope
- Passenger boarding bridge (PBB) compatibility
- Door threshold height and accessibility per [CS-25.783](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)
- Evacuation demonstration per [CS-25.803](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)
- Emergency exit slide deployment and performance
- Passenger flow modeling and simulation validation
- Accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility (PRM)

## 4. Safety Criticality
**Design Assurance Level**: DAL A (Catastrophic) per [SAE ARP4754A](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp4754a/)

Evacuation capability is a primary airworthiness requirement:
- 90-second full cabin evacuation ([CS-25.803](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes))
- All exits available in normal configuration
- 50% of exits blocked in emergency configuration
