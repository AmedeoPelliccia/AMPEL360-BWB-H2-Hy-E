# Energy Infrastructure V&V

## 1. Mission
Verification and validation of energy infrastructure interfaces, including ground power, renewable energy integration, and electrical distribution systems.

## 2. Key Documents
*   [Energy Infrastructure V&V Plan](./85-00-07-701_Energy_Infrastructure_V_and_V_Plan.md)
*   [Grid and Ground Power Verification](./85-00-07-702_Grid_and_Ground_Power_Verification.md)
*   [Renewable and H2 Plant Integration Validation](./85-00-07-703_Renewable_and_H2_Plant_Integration_Validation.md)

## 3. Test Scope
- Ground power unit (GPU) electrical interface per [ISO 6858](https://www.iso.org/standard/13368.html)
- Fixed ground power (400 Hz) and solid-state converters
- Renewable energy integration (solar, wind)
- H2 production plant (electrolyzer) interface
- Energy storage systems (batteries, grid buffers)
- Power quality and harmonic distortion
- Emergency power backup and redundancy

## 4. Performance Targets
- **Voltage Stability**: 115/200 VAC ±3%
- **Frequency**: 400 Hz ±1%
- **Harmonics**: THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) < 5%
- **Availability**: ≥ 99.9% for mission-critical power
