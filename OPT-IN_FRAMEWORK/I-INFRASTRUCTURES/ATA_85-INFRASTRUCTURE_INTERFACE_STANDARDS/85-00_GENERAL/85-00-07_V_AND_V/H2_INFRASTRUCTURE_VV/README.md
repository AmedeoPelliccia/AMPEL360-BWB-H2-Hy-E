# H2 Infrastructure V&V

## 1. Mission
Verification and validation of liquid hydrogen (LH2) refueling infrastructure interfaces, safety zones, and operational procedures.

## 2. Key Documents
*   [H2 Infrastructure V&V Plan](./85-00-07-201_H2_Infrastructure_V_and_V_Plan.md)
*   [Safety Zones and Distances Verification](./85-00-07-202_Safety_Zones_and_Distances_Verification.md)
*   [Refuelling Flow and Capacity Validation](./85-00-07-203_Refuelling_Flow_and_Capacity_Validation.md)

## 3. Test Scope
- LH2 refueling connector compatibility per ISO 19880-3
- Flow rate and pressure control verification
- Leak detection and emergency shutdown validation
- Safety zone compliance per [ISO/TR 15916](https://www.iso.org/standard/29316.html)
- Cryogenic material compatibility and thermal management
- Operator training and procedural validation

## 4. Safety Criticality
**Design Assurance Level**: DAL A (Catastrophic) per [SAE ARP4754A](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp4754a/)

H2 refueling is a safety-critical interface requiring:
- Redundant leak detection
- Automatic emergency shutdown
- Fail-safe mechanical coupling
- Personnel safety training per [NFPA 2](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=2)
