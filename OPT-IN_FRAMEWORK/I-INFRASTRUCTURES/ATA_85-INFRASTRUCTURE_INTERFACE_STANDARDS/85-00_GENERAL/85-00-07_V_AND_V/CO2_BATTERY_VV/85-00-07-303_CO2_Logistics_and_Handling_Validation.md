# 85-00-07-303: CO2 Logistics and Handling Validation

## 1. Purpose
Validate the operational procedures, ground handling equipment, and logistics workflows for CO2 battery charging, discharging, and servicing.

## 2. Operational Scenarios
### 2.1 Normal Operations
- **Turnaround Service**: Partial discharge/charge during gate operations
- **Full Service**: Complete discharge and recharge (maintenance, long ground time)
- **Standby**: Battery maintained at operational pressure, no servicing

### 2.2 Abnormal Operations
- **Emergency Discharge**: Rapid depressurization for safety
- **Low CO2 Purity**: Reject and vent contaminated CO2
- **Equipment Failure**: Manual backup procedures

## 3. Ground Handling Equipment (GHE)
### 3.1 CO2 Ground Cart
- **Capacity**: Sufficient for full aircraft battery charge
- **Mobility**: Towable or self-propelled for apron operations
- **Interface**: Compatible with aircraft CO2 charging port
- **Safety**: Integrated pressure monitoring, emergency shutoff, CO2 detection

### 3.2 Venting Equipment
- **Vent Capture**: Optional capture system for CO2 recycling
- **Dispersion**: Safe venting to atmosphere (if no capture)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time CO2 concentration measurement

## 4. Validation Methods
### 4.1 Procedure Validation
- **Desktop Review**: Walk-through with operations and maintenance teams
- **Mockup Trials**: Hands-on practice with ground cart and aircraft mockup
- **Time Study**: Measure actual service times vs. turnaround targets

### 4.2 GHE Compatibility
- **Physical Fit**: Verify cart positioning and hose reach
- **Coupling**: Mechanical connection and leak check procedures
- **Electrical/Data**: If applicable, verify control interface

### 4.3 Personnel Training
- **Ground Crew**: Certification on CO2 handling safety and procedures
- **Maintenance**: Troubleshooting, preventive maintenance, defect reporting
- **Emergency Response**: Leak response, fire (if applicable), personnel rescue

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
### 5.1 Performance
- **Service Time**: Turnaround charge ≤ 15 minutes (target)
- **Coupling Time**: Connection/disconnection < 3 minutes
- **Reliability**: ≥ 99% successful connections (no leaks, no rework)

### 5.2 Safety
- **CO2 Exposure**: All personnel trained, no exposure > OSHA PEL
- **Incidents**: Zero safety incidents during validation trials
- **Compliance**: Airport authority and airline sign-off

## 6. Logistics Validation
### 6.1 CO2 Supply Chain
- **Availability**: CO2 supply available at target airports
- **Quality**: Verify supplier CO2 meets purity specifications
- **Delivery**: Logistics for ground cart replenishment

### 6.2 Maintenance Support
- **Spare Parts**: Availability of critical components (valves, seals, hoses)
- **Tools**: Special tooling requirements documented and available
- **Troubleshooting**: Fault isolation procedures validated

## 7. Documentation
- **Operating Procedures**: Published in Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM)
- **Training Materials**: Ground crew training modules
- **Test Reports**: [85-00-07-A-302](./ASSETS/85-00-07-A-302_CO2_Battery_Test_Reports.xlsx)
