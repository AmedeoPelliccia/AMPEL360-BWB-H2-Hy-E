# Ground Services Interface V&V

## 1. Mission
Verification and validation of ground service equipment (GSE) interfaces, including ground power, air conditioning, and turnaround workflows.

## 2. Key Documents
*   [Ground Services Interface V&V Plan](./85-00-07-401_Ground_Services_Interface_V_and_V_Plan.md)
*   [GSE Access and Clearance Verification](./85-00-07-402_GSE_Access_and_Clearance_Verification.md)
*   [Turnaround Time and Flow Validation](./85-00-07-403_Turnaround_Time_and_Flow_Validation.md)

## 3. Test Scope
- Ground power unit (GPU) electrical interface per [ISO 6858](https://www.iso.org/standard/13368.html)
- Pre-conditioned air (PCA) duct compatibility
- Potable water and lavatory service access
- Cargo loading equipment clearance
- Catering truck access and galley service
- Turnaround time optimization and workflow validation

## 4. Performance Targets
- **Turnaround Time**: ≤ airline-specific targets (typically 30-45 minutes)
- **GPU Connection**: < 3 minutes from aircraft arrival
- **PCA Connection**: < 5 minutes for passenger comfort
- **Cargo Loading**: ≤ 15 minutes for full belly load
