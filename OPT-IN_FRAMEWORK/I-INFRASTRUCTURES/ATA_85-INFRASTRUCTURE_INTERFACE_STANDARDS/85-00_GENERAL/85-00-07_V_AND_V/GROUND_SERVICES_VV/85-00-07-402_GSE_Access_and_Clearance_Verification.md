# 85-00-07-402: GSE Access and Clearance Verification

## 1. Purpose
Verify that all ground service equipment can access their respective service points without clearance conflicts or operational constraints.

## 2. Service Points Verification
### 2.1 Ground Power
- **GPU Connection Point**: Height, location, cable routing clearance
- **Receptacle Design**: Standard ISO 6858 compatibility
- **Cable Management**: Avoid trip hazards, pinch points

### 2.2 Pre-Conditioned Air (PCA)
- **Duct Connection**: Height-adjustable duct compatibility
- **Airflow Distribution**: Cabin zones coverage, temperature uniformity
- **Disconnect Safety**: Automatic shutoff on duct separation

### 2.3 Potable Water and Lavatory Service
- **Service Panel Access**: Ground crew reach without ladders (if possible)
- **Fill/Drain Rates**: Flow capacity for turnaround time targets
- **Contamination Prevention**: Sealed connections, no cross-contamination

### 2.4 Catering Service
- **Galley Door Access**: Height clearance for catering trucks
- **Lift Compatibility**: Standard catering high-loaders
- **Load Path**: Clearance for carts entering/exiting galleys

### 2.5 Cargo Loading
- **Cargo Door Dimensions**: Standard ULD compatibility (LD3, LD6, etc.)
- **Sill Height**: Power cargo loader (PCL) compatibility
- **Loading Clearance**: No aircraft structure interference during loading

## 3. Verification Methods
### 3.1 CAD Analysis
- 3D GSE envelope overlays on aircraft model
- Collision detection for all service positions

### 3.2 Physical Testing (Mockup)
- Position representative GSE around aircraft mockup
- Measure actual clearances, document constraints
- Operator feedback on accessibility and ergonomics

### 3.3 Operational Trials
- Conduct turnaround operations with airline ground crews
- Video documentation of all GSE operations
- Identify bottlenecks, interference, safety concerns

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **Clearance**: ≥ 0.3 m minimum between GSE and aircraft structure
- **Accessibility**: All service points reachable by standard GSE
- **Simultaneous Operations**: GPU, PCA, water, lavatory serviceable concurrently
- **Safety**: No pinch points, trip hazards, or overhead clearance violations
