# 85-00-07-102: Clearance and Compatibility Verification

## 1. Purpose
Verify that the aircraft's physical dimensions and maneuvering characteristics are compatible with airport taxiway, gate, and apron infrastructure.

## 2. Test Objectives
### 2.1 Taxiway Clearances
- **Wing Tip Clearance**: Minimum distance from taxiway centerline to wing tips during straight and turn maneuvers
- **Tail Clearance**: Ensure vertical stabilizer clears taxiway lighting and signage
- **Engine Clearance**: Verify ground clearance and FOD ingestion risk mitigation

### 2.2 Gate Compatibility
- **Approach Angle**: Validate tow-in and self-maneuvering gate entry
- **Parking Position**: Confirm fuselage alignment with passenger boarding bridges (PBB)
- **Ground Service Access**: Verify clearance for catering trucks, fuel bowsers, GSE

### 2.3 Apron Maneuvers
- **180° Turn Radius**: Measure effective turn radius on apron
- **Pushback Clearance**: Validate tug attachment points and clearance during pushback
- **Wingtip Proximity**: Confirm safe separation from adjacent parked aircraft

## 3. Test Methods
### 3.1 Analysis
- **CAD Sweeps**: 3D modeling of aircraft envelope through taxiway/gate geometries
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Statistical analysis of positioning errors

### 3.2 Physical Testing
- **Mockup Trials**: 1:1 scale mockup positioned at test facility apron
- **Instrumentation**: Laser trackers, DGPS for position accuracy
- **Video Recording**: Multi-angle documentation for clearance verification

### 3.3 Operational Demonstration
- **Pilot Evaluation**: Line pilots perform gate approach and taxi maneuvers
- **Ground Crew Feedback**: Airport personnel assess GSE access and safety

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **Taxiway Clearance**: ≥ 4.5 m clearance from taxiway edge to wing tip (ICAO Code E)
- **Gate Clearance**: ≥ 7.5 m from gate structure to aircraft extremities
- **Turn Radius**: ≤ airport-specific constraints for designated taxi routes
