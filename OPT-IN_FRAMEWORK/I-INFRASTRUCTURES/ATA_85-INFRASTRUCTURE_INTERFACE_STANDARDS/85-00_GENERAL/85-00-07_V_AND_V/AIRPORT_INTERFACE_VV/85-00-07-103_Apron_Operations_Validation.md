# 85-00-07-103: Apron Operations Validation

## 1. Purpose
Validate the operational procedures and workflows for apron operations, including pushback, towing, parking, and ground service equipment (GSE) positioning.

## 2. Test Objectives
### 2.1 Pushback Procedures
- **Tug Compatibility**: Verify tow bar attachment and load limits
- **Clearance Verification**: Confirm pushback trajectory clears adjacent aircraft and structures
- **Communication**: Validate radio and visual signaling between flight deck and ground crew

### 2.2 Towing Operations
- **Long-Distance Tow**: Hangar-to-gate or inter-terminal towing
- **Emergency Tow**: Disabled aircraft recovery procedures
- **Speed Limits**: Compliance with airport authority towing speed restrictions

### 2.3 GSE Operations
- **Catering Access**: Height and reach compatibility with catering trucks
- **Ground Power Unit (GPU)**: Connection point accessibility and cable routing
- **Air Start Unit (ASU)**: Pneumatic connection verification
- **Lavatory Service**: Waste and water service panel access

## 3. Test Methods
### 3.1 Dry Runs (Simulation)
- **Desktop Walkthrough**: Procedural review with airport operations staff
- **VR Simulation**: Ground crew perform operations in virtual environment

### 3.2 Physical Trials (Mockup)
- **Towing Tests**: Actual tug and tow bar mated to aircraft mockup
- **GSE Positioning**: Trucks and equipment positioned around mockup
- **Clearance Measurement**: Document actual clearances vs. design assumptions

### 3.3 Operational Validation (Live Aircraft)
- **First Article**: Validation with production-representative aircraft at test facility
- **Airport Trials**: Selected airports (hub and regional) for final validation

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **Pushback Time**: ≤ airline standard (typically 3-5 minutes)
- **Towing Speed**: Compliance with airport limits (typically 5-10 km/h)
- **GSE Access**: All service panels accessible without aircraft relocation
- **Safety**: Zero incidents during validation trials

## 5. Documentation
- **Video**: All operations recorded for training material
- **Procedures**: Validated procedures published in Airport Planning Manual (APM)
- **Feedback**: Airport authority and airline operator sign-off
