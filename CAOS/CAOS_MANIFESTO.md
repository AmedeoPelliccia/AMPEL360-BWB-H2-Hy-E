## Executive Summary

For fifty years digital engineering relied on three pillars: **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design), **CAE** (Computer-Aided Engineering) and **CAM** (Computer-Aided Manufacturing). These pillars enabled unprecedented capabilities to model, validate and produce physical artifacts.

We are now consolidating a fourth pillar enabled by artificial intelligence: **CAOS — Computer Aided Operations and Services**. CAOS digitizes cognition and decision-making in real time: an intelligent layer that manages, optimizes and sustains complex systems while they operate.

CAOS closes the digital lifecycle loop: operational data continuously feed Digital Twins and Service Twins that learn and evolve. This shift enables the move from Product-as-a-Service to **Product-as-Intelligent-Service (PaaSI)** — the primary value becomes the guaranteed operational result delivered by AI, not only the physical hardware. CAOS also closes the longstanding PLM blind spot on in-service lifecycle, end-of-life and sustainability decisions.

## 1. The Evolution of "Computer-Aided Everything"

The adoption of computing in engineering progressed through four logical stages:

### CAD — Design (digitizing geometry)
3D models became the authoritative source for product definition and the core of PLM.

### CAE — Engineering (digitizing physics)
Digital validation via FEA, CFD and multi-physics simulation reduced prototypes and accelerated design confidence.

### CAM — Manufacturing (digitizing production)
Direct linkage from digital models to production equipment: CNC, robotics, additive manufacturing.

### CAOS — Operations & Services (digitizing cognition and decision)
The Digital Twin evolves into a Service Twin that not only simulates but decides and acts autonomously in operation.

**In short:**  
Design with CAD → Validate with CAE → Manufacture with CAM → **Operate with CAOS**.

## 2. Anatomy of CAOS — What it is and what it does

CAOS is not a single tool but a cognitive architecture that applies intelligence to running systems. It covers two complementary domains and shares a common operational mechanism.

### 2.1 Physical domain (atoms)

- **Orchestration of complex systems:** real-time coordination of fleets, plants, power networks.
- **Cognitive maintenance (Industrial AIOps):** prediction, root-cause diagnosis, logistics planning and operation optimization up to the repair.
- **Service Twin:** simulates operations, logistics and cost to validate consequences before acting.

### 2.2 Digital & service domain (bits)

- **Cognitive service agents:** bots and agents that not only answer but execute, update backend systems and learn from interactions.
- **Cognitive process management (BPM+AI):** continuous monitoring and autonomous remediation of business workflows.
- **AIOps for IT:** autonomous management of infrastructure, security and performance.

### 2.3 Common mechanism

Both domains use the **OODA loop** (Observe → Orient → Decide → Act) where Decide and Act are performed by models pursuing high-level objectives (the what), not rigid scripts (the how).

---

## 3. Autodetermination — the defining trait

CAOS tends toward **autodetermination**: systems that, given objectives, determine their own actions and learn from outcomes.

Autodetermination means:
- Deciding **what to do** and **how to do it**
- Optimizing toward complex objectives (uptime, efficiency, carbon footprint, SLA)
- Adapting when results deviate

This is the shift from **automation** (rule following) to **autonomy** (goal-oriented decision making and learning).

**Autodetermination requires governance:** operational limits, approval zones, verifiable upgrade processes.

---

## 4. The CAOS Technology Stack — enabling autodetermination

Autodetermination is an emergent property of an integrated, federated architecture:

### A. Senses — Observe

- **Physical domain:** IoT sensors, cameras, LIDAR, telemetry
- **Digital domain:** APIs, event streams, logs, transactions

### B. Brain & Simulator — Orient & Decide

- **AI/ML models:** predictive, prescriptive, generative
- **Digital Twins & Service Twins:** simulate decisions and verify outcomes before deployment

### C. Campus of evolution — Learn & Govern

- **Cloud Computing Campus (CCC):** centralized MLOps environment where models are trained, validated and stress-tested
- **Supervised sessions (Human-in-the-Loop):** domain experts validate critical upgrades
- **Federated upgrades:** edges learn locally, send model improvements (not raw data) to the Campus, which integrates and re-distributes validated upgrades

### D. Nervous system federated — Communicate

- **Edge computing:** low-latency reflexes and local autonomy
- **Cloud orchestration:** global analytics, fleet-level coordination and heavy training workloads

### E. Actuators — Act

- **Physical spaces:** Robotics / Cobots
- **Digital systems:** RPA and APIs enabling actions across enterprise software

## 5. Strategic Impact — from PLM to PaaSI and circularity

CAOS changes business models and completes lifecycle management:

### 5.1 The PLM gap

Traditional PLM focused on product creation (design → manufacture → sell) but often lost visibility and actionable data once an asset entered service. End-of-life and sustainability decisions remained disconnected.

### 5.2 CAOS closes the loop

CAOS manages operation, maintenance, retirement and circular decisions in-service:

- **SLM / OLI:** Service Lifecycle Management and Operations Lifecycle Intelligence focus on operational data and autonomous decision making
- **PaaSI — Product as Intelligent Service:** customers buy guaranteed operational outcomes (uptime, optimized efficiency, minimal footprint) delivered by CAOS; hardware becomes the execution substrate of an intelligent service

### 5.3 Sustainability & digital passport

- CAOS continuously measures operational sustainability (consumption, emissions)
- Maintains a **Digital Passport** for each asset: full operational and maintenance history enables optimal choices at end-of-life (remanufacture, refurbish, recycle)
- Enables true **circular economy** decisions based on data-driven cost/benefit and material recovery models

---

## 6. Governance, safety and adoption constraints

Autonomy demands robust governance and verification:

- **MLOps with governance:** dataset provenance, model lineage, metrics for safety, fairness and robustness
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight:** critical decisions require supervised approval channels and safe rollback policies
- **CCC supervised sessions:** pre-deploy validation for upgrades
- **Security & robustness:** adversarial resilience, fault-tolerance, graceful degradation
- **Verification & certification:** bench testing, field trials and operational metrics for certifiable deployments and PaaSI contracts

---

## 7. Example use cases

### Aviation
Fleet health management, fuel/energy optimization, regenerative strategies, digital passporting for remanufacture.

### Energy
Microgrid orchestration, hybrid storage optimization, demand response.

### Manufacturing
Adaptive production planning, in-line quality control and sustainability optimization.

### Services / IT
Intelligent customer support that executes across backend systems; AI agents that manage CI/CD autonomously.

---

## 8. Roadmap — practical next steps

1. **Define operational objectives** and measureable KPIs/SLOs per use case
2. **Build a CCC prototype** and MLOps pipelines integrated with Digital/Service Twins
3. **Deploy federated edge pilots** with supervised upgrade flows
4. **Measure, audit and certify** behavior, safety and sustainability metrics
5. **Scale to production** and create PaaSI commercial models

## Conclusion

CAOS is the fourth pillar of the digital engineering stack: the era where AI stops being a design-time assistant and becomes an operationally autonomous agent that runs, optimizes and sustains both physical and digital systems. It fills the PLM blind spot, enables Product-as-Intelligent-Service (PaaSI) business models, and is the operational backbone for sustainable, circular lifecycle decisions.

For the AMPEL360-BWB-H₂-Hy-E project, CAOS provides the intelligent operational layer that ensures the hybrid hydrogen aircraft concept delivers on its promises of efficiency, sustainability, and autonomous fleet management.
